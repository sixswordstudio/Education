# To whom it may concern
This is a private letter to you, written with the hope that it finds you well. We haven't met, so may I please take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Amy Park. 

Entry into your program is competitive. There are plenty of people who vie for a seat in the lecture halls at Ontario Tech, and my aspiration is to be counted as one of those hard-working people. 

There are lots of worthy candidates, people who deserve the opportunity, who persevere through massive systemic adversities far worse than I have faced. And while I do have intersectional identity issues that clash with the norms of society, I still can't help but feel guilty for asking for a chance to continue my education. I have to acknowledge that my life has been comparatively easy, full of open doors that were not available equally to everyone. A better person would have realized that, and use gratitude to stay grounded. 

But instead, I self-immolated in 2015 after suppressed memories of rape resurfaced in the face of a new instance of sexual harassment. I reported the harassment, and it was suggested to me that I move out, so I did. The isolation was stark in comparison to the social setting of the dorms.

Still, I should have kept my eye on the real priority. The education I felt slipping out of my grasp, while the depression was eating me alive. If I could go back, I would implore myself to realize, he took what he took from us; I shouldn't let him take our bright future as well. 

So my academic record includes courses that I withdrew from after the official deadline had passed. I didn't go through proper processes, but I also paid off all debts and had several semesters of great marks, deans list, and awards. No academic integrity issues, just an unlucky person who also at times made penny-wise-poud-foolish decisions. 

I feel shame for those failures on my transcript, regardless of why it happened. 

That shame. My honour and education, dead. Yet another future made a casualty of sexual violence in my society. I lacked the inner strength to admit that it had such an impact on me. This is the way that rape haunts me. 

But I am not at the end of my life. There is time yet for me to change the legacy of my rape. Instead of an eternal stagnant wasteland, it could be something else.

What if I'm not believed? What if I'm selling out? What if I'm rejected anyway? 

If I had proof, why didn't I go to court about it? Do I have to go to court and win before I allow myself to admit that it happened? If I can admit to myself that it happened, am I allowed to explain its impact on me?

But then something happened. A new wind gusted in the sails of my spirit. A woman named Gisèle Pelicot, standing in a court of law, seeking justice. 

Shame must change sides, she said. 

"I wanted all woman victims of rape – not just when they have been drugged, rape exists at all levels – I want those women to say: Mrs Pelicot did it, we can do it too. When you’re raped there is shame, and it’s not for us to have shame, it’s for them." ^[[Gisèle Pelicot tells mass rape trial ‘it’s not for us to have shame – it’s for them’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/gisele-pelicot-rape-trial-france-court)]

"I’m 72 soon and I’m not sure my life will be long enough to recover from this,” said the former logistics manager, who was repeatedly unknowingly sedated and raped by her then husband" ^[[Gisèle Pelicot tells mass rape trial ‘it’s not for us to have shame – it’s for them’](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/gisele-pelicot-rape-trial-france-court)]

I wonder if Gisèle would aspire to continue her education, if she were in my shoes. Would she name the reason that she withdrew from several courses after the deadline? What would a woman without shame say about her rape's role in her withdrawals from class?

When I was being brave, I let it go. At that time I couldn't speak up, because I didn't want to "use it as an excuse", or acknowledge its power to derail my life and education like that.  

Truthfully, I don't want to talk about it. 

Other than to say, I don't want the things that happened without my consent to define my identity, or my future. By naming it, and sharing the facts with you, I am reaching out to request your aid in giving back this shame to whom it belongs. Some burdens are too heavy to shed alone.

If you would, please consider letting me join the cohort of students enrolled in this program. I would work my hardest to represent the school well in everything that I do, and let nothing get in the way of success. This skill I have learned in my career as a technical writer for business-to-business software-as-a-service platforms, where I planned and executed knowledge management projects. 

There has been a need in Ontario for French language teachers, and I wish to respond to that call to action. To serve my community by passing on knowledge and passion for languages to the next generations. So with that dream in mind, I've been studying. French vocabulary, French immersion, grammar and syntax, style and conventions. 

As a former French Immersion student, it feels a little like fate. But it's not God, or bravery. It's a Gisèlian determination to change society that empowers some women. 

French, then, in honour of Mme. Pelicot, and for the little girls.



Thank you for considering my application,

Sincerely, 

Amy Park.
