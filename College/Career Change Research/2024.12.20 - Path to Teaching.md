* [Ontario's French Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy 2021-2025](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-french-teacher-recruitment-and-retention-strategy-2021-2025)
  - The actions in this strategy are informed through [consultation with the Working Group on the Teacher Shortage](https://www.ontario.ca/page/report-shortage-teachers-ontarios-french-language-education-system) in the French-language Education System, which included representatives from:

  - the teacher federation, [Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens](https://aefo.on.ca/fr/) (AEFO)
  - school boards, [Association franco-ontarienne des conseils scolaires catholiques](https://afocsc.org/) (AFOCSC) and [Association des conseils scolaires des écoles publiques de l’Ontario](https://www.acepo.org/en/) (ACÉPO)
  - the Ministry of Education
  - [Ontario College of Teachers](https://www.oct.ca/)
  - two French Language faculties of education at [University of Ottawa](https://education.uottawa.ca/en) and [Laurentian University](https://laurentian.ca/faculty/education)
  - [French principals’ association](https://adfo.org/home/)
  - [Centre Franco](https://www.lecentrefranco.ca/), an organization that develops resources and pedagogical material for French Language education

    The French as a Second Language actions in the strategy are informed by key findings and recommendations from the FSL Ontario Labour Market Partnership (OLMP) Project.

# Potential Issues
- There is lack of funding in a lot of areas
- I may not be able to get in to a B.Ed due to my grades
- It will be difficult to get teaching experience
- I may not be able to get enough French courses to count as a teachable
- The career is mentally / emotionally / physically taxing

# Potential opportunities
- Teaching in the school system isn't the only thing I can do with a B.Ed. (Adult education in tech)
- I love kids and wouldn't mind teaching in a smaller town outside of DDSB or TDSB. (Kawartha?)
