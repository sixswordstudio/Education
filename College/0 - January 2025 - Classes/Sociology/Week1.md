### Online code of conduct: standards of behaviour
In short, I expect you to engage with myself and your peers respectfully during any and all interactions. Since most of our communication is written, please proofread your messages for manners, politeness, tone, and intention. 

We discuss sensitive topics in this class and disrespect, anger, humiliation, rudeness, or inflammatory speculation will not be tolerated, regardless of intention. 

If you are unsure, speak to Dr. Kianpour privately.

### Academic Integrity: required reading
Academic integrity means academic honesty. Students are responsible for completing their studies in an open, honest, and responsible manner. This means doing and submitting your own work, citing sources appropriately, and not engaging in behaviours that would be considered to be a breach of academic integrity (e.g COPY/PASTE). If you are not 100% clear on what any of the above means, it is your responsibility to make sure that you do before handing in any work.

#### In-depth information from the Course Outline about Academic Integrity
All students at Durham College have the responsibility to familiarize themselves with and abide by the
college’s Academic Integrity Policy. Students are expected to complete and submit their own work in an
honest manner, in accordance with the policy. Durham College has zero tolerance for breaches of academic
integrity. All suspected breaches of academic integrity will be investigated and documented following
procedures outlined in the policy, and should a breach be confirmed, appropriate penalties will be levied.
Breaches of academic integrity refer to a variety of practices including, but not limited to:

• copying another person’s work;
• using unauthorized materials or resources during an evaluation;
• obtaining unauthorized copies of evaluations in advance;
• collaborating without permission;
• colluding or providing unauthorized assistance;
• falsifying academic documents or records;
• misrepresenting academic credentials;
• buying, selling, stealing, soliciting, exchanging or transacting materials or information for the purpose of
academic gain;
• bribing or attempting to bribe personnel;
• impersonation;
• submitting the same work in more than one course without authorization;
• improper use of computer technology and the internet;
• depriving others of academic resources;
• misrepresenting reasons for special consideration of academic work;
• plagiarizing or failing to acknowledge ideas, data, graphics or other content without proper and full
acknowledgement;
• any unauthorized use of generative or other artificial intelligence.

If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic conduct or research and
citation methods, and what your responsibilities are towards academic integrity, please visit the Academic
Integrity website on MyDC, reach out to Student Academic Learning Services (SALS), or speak with your
professor or Student Advisor.


### Sociology Mindset: Learning zones
* Red: I can't learn this, it's too hard, I don't get it, I don't like it, I don't agree, I'm checking out. Asking rhetorical questions, purposely controversial questions, in order to advance your own opinion. Shutting down, in denial, lack of effort.

* Yellow: I may not know this yet, but I'd like to know more. I may know a lot, but I will continue to think critically, engage, and not assume I'm an expert. Open, unbiased, objective, willing to share and also to learn. 

* Green: I'm an expert! I already know everything there is to know. There isn't possibly any new information about this topic I'm not privy to. I'm the authority. Presumptive, close-minded, leads to a stalemate of knowledge.

### Why GNEDs
General Education Classes are important to your education. Being able to explore new topics that compliment your certificate, diploma, or degreee is a valuable experience; employers desire well-rounded individuals. What do you want to get out of your GNEDs?

### Sneak Peek
* 1 theme of the semester will be "FAKE NEWS"
* We will learn how to identify misinformation or unreliable sources
* We will learn how to verify and find quality sources of info in order to navigate the internet for personal and academic use
* You'll practice this weekly and more in depth on Assignment #1. 

### FAQ
Do we have a lecture in this class?
Technically, no—this is a fully asynchronous online class, meaning we won’t meet face-to-face. However, you are expected to check the course content regularly and complete all the weekly activities. I encourage you to develop a personal routine early in the semester to stay on top of the content and actively engage with the various activities.

#### Can I submit my work late? 
It depends.

Quizzes - yes. The "due dates" are just a suggestion; you can choose to complete them anytime before the last day of classes. 

Major assignments (midterm and final assignments) can be submitted late with a penalty of 10%/day.

Weekly Activities are NOT accepted late and CANNOT be made up since they are low-value items and often open for week(s) at a time until they are due.

#### Can I "make up" work or have extra work to boost my mark? 
Nope! 

This is not a practice I use. However, I will provide ample opportunity for any extra help and support you may need with your regularly assigned evaluations. 


#### I'm failing/falling behind/missed classes or assignments because of ______. What do I do? 
If you have an extenuating circumstance that is preventing you from attending class/complete your work, if possible you should be proactively consulting with your instructor to establish solutions together. Please never hesitate to reach out to your instructor for support as early as possible. We will provide you with as much support and information we can give you. In addition, consider contact with the Academic Advisor for your department, Centre for Teaching & Learning, Access Centre, or the Campus Wellness Centre for additional resources.


#### I'm having a really hard time coping. My mental health is suffering. What can I do?  
Your professors are here to point you in the right direction for support you may need throughout the semester in regard to your mental health. These are the resources that can support students both on-campus or off. Whether you're experiencing a crisis or just feeling overwhelmed, there is support available for you at DC.

Option #1: Written
Click "start new thread" and answer the questions listed below in a written format. Click "post" and you're done! 

Option #2: Video
Click "start new thread" and then click the "insert stuff" button (it looks like a little 'play' symbol) and then "add video note." There, you can record your answers to the questions below directly from your webcam and insert the clip into the post instead of typing. Click "post" and you're done!


**Questions:**

1. Introduce yourself. Tell us 3 things about you or your life. Feel free to use words, images, GIFs, or videos to describe your life! Pictures of pets are encouraged ;)

2. List at least one goal for this semester. It could be related to grades, skills, social, personal, wellness, habits, mindset... anything at all. Let's set some positive intentions! 

3. Well... normally here I would ask you about a current event that interested you recently, but I think we're all pretty spent on that topic. So... if you were a professional wrestler what would be your entrance theme song?
