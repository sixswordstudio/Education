## Task Instructions

Introducing yourself, especially while we're online, really helps me connect with you. Please read and comment on a peer's post, too. If you're up for it, include a selfie so we can all put names to faces (no pressure).I know you're probably doing quite a few of these this week, so THANK YOU!

Option #1: Written
Click "start new thread" and answer the questions listed below in a written format. Click "post" and you're done! 

Option #2: Video
Click "start new thread" and then click the "insert stuff" button (it looks like a little 'play' symbol) and then "add video note." There, you can record your answers to the questions below directly from your webcam and insert the clip into the post instead of typing. Click "post" and you're done!


**Questions:**

1. Introduce yourself. Tell us 3 things about you or your life. Feel free to use words, images, GIFs, or videos to describe your life! Pictures of pets are encouraged ;)

2. List at least one goal for this semester. It could be related to grades, skills, social, personal, wellness, habits, mindset... anything at all. Let's set some positive intentions! 

3. Well... normally here I would ask you about a current event that interested you recently, but I think we're all pretty spent on that topic. So... if you were a professional wrestler what would be your entrance theme song?
