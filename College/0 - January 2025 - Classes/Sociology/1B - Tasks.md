Introducing yourself, especially while we're online, really helps me connect with you. Please read and comment on a peer's post, too. If you're up for it, include a selfie so we can all put names to faces (no pressure).I know you're probably doing quite a few of these this week, so THANK YOU!

Option #1: Written
Click "start new thread" and answer the questions listed below in a written format. Click "post" and you're done! 

Option #2: Video
Click "start new thread" and then click the "insert stuff" button (it looks like a little 'play' symbol) and then "add video note." There, you can record your answers to the questions below directly from your webcam and insert the clip into the post instead of typing. Click "post" and you're done!


## Questions:

1. Introduce yourself. Tell us 3 things about you or your life. Feel free to use words, images, GIFs, or videos to describe your life! Pictures of pets are encouraged ;)

2. List at least one goal for this semester. It could be related to grades, skills, social, personal, wellness, habits, mindset... anything at all. Let's set some positive intentions! 

3. Well... normally here I would ask you about a current event that interested you recently, but I think we're all pretty spent on that topic. So... if you were a professional wrestler what would be your entrance theme song? 


## Answers

### 1. Introduction:
_. My name is Amy. I was a technical writer, but my job was part of a tech sector layoff this year. That's just business, it's nothing personal, but it sucks. So now, I'm working on finding my voice in fiction writing, returning to my education, reading, and meditating while thinking about what to do next. My favourite book read in 2024 was "Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage", the story of Shackleton and his crew stranded in Antarctica for 2 years._

### 2. Goals for the semester:
_. My goal this year is to get good grades, walk more, and talk to more real people in my community._

### 3. Wrestling song: 
_. If I were a pro wrestler, my entrance theme song would be the chorus of Cruel Road by Pallbearer. It would be pretty badass to step out to those lyrics, and the doom metal bass / guitar reflects my overall mood these days._
