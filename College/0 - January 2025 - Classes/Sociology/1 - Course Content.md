# Week 1 Course Content
Welcome to GNED 1407 - Introduction to Sociology! This week we are going to focus on setting the scene for our semester. We aren't going to dive into any substantial content just yet, as I simply want to familiarize you with our course details first. I consider week 1 to be the most important week to pay attention - many of your questions get answered before you even ask them! 

Read through this page from top to bottom, making sure to pay attention to the headings and descriptions as they will point out relevant action items. Your weekly content pages will look similar throughout the semester, so you should get used to this layout pretty quickly; it is designed to be easy to use (if you have notes on what could be simplified or ever come across broken links, please let me know!). 

## Learning Outcomes & Key Terms

### Reading:

This week you don't have any course content reading, but please read the entirety of this page; lots of important stuff!

### Lesson: 

This week I have provided two separate files; one is the course introduction - this contains important information that will walk you through how this course will work. The other is a very brief introductory lesson defining "sociology." You may choose to view the Google Slides or PowerPoint. The PowerPoint also includes audio captions. 

**Don't forget there is additional information provided in the 'notes' section!**

# Today's lesson will discuss the topic of suicide from a sociological perspective.

## Slide 4: Lauryn Hill - Everything is Everything
- I like to start each class with a song to get us thinking about the topic. There are no right or wrong answers, just food for thought. 
- Consider: What is the message of the song? How do the lyrics or melody relate to your current ideas about the world, social groups, opportunity, fairness, etc.?

_Amy: Lauryn Hill's line "Everything is everything / After winter, must come spring" relates to my idea about the world and social groups as having seasons. Natural cycles over which we have no real control. There are some things that are out of our hands, that can't be changed but also can't be our fault. It's the natural balance of the world, where we can't take any season for granted because it always comes to a close. Whether that's a season of love and light, or a season of dark depression. It speaks to being humbled by the fact that the world keeps worlding while we're playing our social games. Win or lose, or completely lost, nothing in life is guaranteed. "Change, it comes eventually."_
