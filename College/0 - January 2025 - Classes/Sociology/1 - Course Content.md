# Week 1 Course Content
Welcome to GNED 1407 - Introduction to Sociology! This week we are going to focus on setting the scene for our semester. We aren't going to dive into any substantial content just yet, as I simply want to familiarize you with our course details first. I consider week 1 to be the most important week to pay attention - many of your questions get answered before you even ask them! 

Read through this page from top to bottom, making sure to pay attention to the headings and descriptions as they will point out relevant action items. Your weekly content pages will look similar throughout the semester, so you should get used to this layout pretty quickly; it is designed to be easy to use (if you have notes on what could be simplified or ever come across broken links, please let me know!).

### Lesson: 

This week I have provided two separate files; one is the course introduction - this contains important information that will walk you through how this course will work. The other is a very brief introductory lesson defining "sociology." You may choose to view the Google Slides or PowerPoint. The PowerPoint also includes audio captions. 

**Don't forget there is additional information provided in the 'notes' section!**

# Today's lesson will discuss the topic of suicide from a sociological perspective.

## Slide 4: Lauryn Hill - Everything is Everything
- I like to start each class with a song to get us thinking about the topic. There are no right or wrong answers, just food for thought. 
- Consider: What is the message of the song? How do the lyrics or melody relate to your current ideas about the world, social groups, opportunity, fairness, etc.?

_Amy: Lauryn Hill's line "Everything is everything / After winter, must come spring" relates to my idea about the world and social groups as having seasons. Natural cycles over which we have no real control. There are some things that are out of our hands, that can't be changed but also can't be our fault. It's the natural balance of the world, where we can't take any season for granted because it always comes to a close. Whether that's a season of love and light, or a season of dark depression. It speaks to being humbled by the fact that the world keeps worlding while we're playing our social games. Win or lose, or completely lost, nothing in life is guaranteed. "Change, it comes eventually."_

## Slide 5: What is sociology?
Sociology is a science guided by the basic understanding that our lives are affected, not only by our individual characteristics, but by our place in the social world. 
**What does that really mean?**
* People, groups, and social life can be scientifically studied. Therefore, sociology is a social science. 
* Sociology focuses on social relationships, looking at how others influence our behaviour
  * How major social institutions like the government, religion, and the economy affect us; and how we ourselves affect other individuals, groups, and even organizations.

## Slide 6: Sociological Imagination
* The "tool" essential for beginners to sociology is called "sociological imagination", first proposed by **C. Wright Mills**
* It means: The ability to understand how social forces ("Public Issues") influence the lives of individuals ("Personal Troubles")
* Reflect: Consider one recent economic or political change that had a direct impact on your individual life. Reflect independently, or share your thought on the Lesson Lounge discussion board. 

_Amy: One recent economic change that has had a direct impact on my life as an individual is the rise of Artificial Intelligence. After a 7 year career as a Technical Writer for business-to-business software-as-a-service companies, I was laid off in part due to my role becoming less valuable. Tech in Canada right now is in a rough place. In my role, I was paid a modest $67k CAD a year, but in the states, a similar role with similar level of experience is paid 100+k **USD**. Now my options are getting ever narrower, and there is a "gig economy" rising up in my field, where people with my skill set are lucky if they can land a salary. Recently the SAG went on strike to negotiate protections against AI exploitation for writers and actors in the entertainment industry. There are few if any unions in tech, and it feels taboo to talk about that. I guess I could always just accept a contract gig, training the AI that replaced me. And that's why I'm back in school._

Speaker notes: Developing this perspective asks us to give up the idea that our behaviour is simply a matter of what we decide to do. Now, we must combine an understanding of our individual decisions with how they are impacted by the greater world in which we live. 

## Slide 7: Sociological Imagination - Connecting the...
* General --> Particular
* Strange --> Familiar
* Social --> Individual
* Public --> Private
* Macro --> Micro

## Slide 8: Using the sociological imagination
Sociological perspective / imagination is basically the ability to see relationships or influences of greater society on individual lives. This requires individuals to step outside of their own views and biases to explore connections. Private troubles vs. Public issues. E.G: Is a person unemployed due to a personal trouble or is it due to societal issues?

**Task:**
Independently or using the Lesson Lounge discussion board, make a list of the 5 most pressing social issues facing Canadians. 

1. Discuss how each of them would affect an **individual's** life. (Micro)
2. Discuss how it would affect an entire **population**, like Canada (Macro)

_Amy: My source for the top five social issues facing Canada today is the [Service Canada 2024 Disruptions report](https://horizons.service.canada.ca/en/2024/disruptions) and map. The social issues identified as being the most impactful and most likely to have an impact within 3-10 years are:._

_1. People cannot tell what is true and what is not_

* _**Micro:** Sue doesn't know what news to trust, so she tunes out all of it. On election day, Sue doesn't vote, or votes based on someone else's opinions. Sue is not aware of how she may have been passively influenced by her casual social media use._
* _**Macro:** [The Online News Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/online-news.html) was passed. "The intent of the regulations is to provide platforms the opportunity to reach fair commercial agreements with news businesses, including the possibility of a single agreement with a group of news businesses, and thereby contribute to the overall sustainability of the Canadian news marketplace." Therefore, the Canadian government is concerned about the sustainability of the Canadian news marketplace, and have passed legislation to support it. Regulations passed in support of Canadian news indicate that there are real disruptions in Canadians ability to access relevant news and media at a macro level._

_2. Downward social mobility is the norm_

* _**Micro:** Bob is 35 years old and lives in his mom's basement. When his parents were his age, his dad supported the family on a single income. Bob works two jobs in the gig economy, but still can't afford a place of his own._
* _**Macro:** Canada has numerous strategies in place for decreasing "the degree to which the fortune of children relies on that of their parents." (from the [Canadian Encyclopedia entry on Social Mobility](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/social-mobility)) Therefore, it's a real social issue on a macro level._

_3. Artificial Intelligence runs wild_

* _**Micro:** Amy was laid off in large part because of AI's disruptions to the tech industry._
* _**Macro:** The first line in [The Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) – Companion document](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/innovation-better-canada/en/artificial-intelligence-and-data-act-aida-companion-document)(from Canada.ca): "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are poised to have a significant impact on the lives of Canadians and the operations of Canadian businesses."_

_4. Ageing population has no support_

* _**Micro:** Sue's long term expose to negative stereotypes about aging has led to a self-fulfilling prophecy. She now has low self-esteem, and is having trouble getting her doctor to take her health concerns seriously.'._
* _**Macro:** "Canada faces significant aging of its population in the coming decades that will have profound and wide-ranging impacts on society."... "Ageism is not only a barrier to labour force participation among older adults, it is also a major loss for employers in terms of productivity. Along the same lines, the negative outcomes of ageism on a person’s health ultimately impact the entire health care system’s sustainability. This explains the growing interest in methodologies that can be used to measure and quantify the economic impacts of ageism.", from [Reports: Seniors and aging society (2024-08-28)](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/corporate/reports/seniors-aging.html)(from Canada.ca)._

_5. Values-based clashes in society_

* _**Micro:** Bob feels that his values are not represented in Canadian society. Due to some confrontations online and on the drive home, he is feeling more and more like an outsider, and is losing trust in his community._
* _**Macro:** From the [Canadian Index of Wellbeing](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/about-canadian-index-wellbeing/reflecting-canadian-values) (UWaterloo): "Values are critical. They provide guideposts for how Canada can move forward as a society, how we can orient ourselves during challenging times, how we can inspire our citizens and how we can be confident that the policies and programs we recommend and the path we choose will reflect the vision of our citizens." "... "Social Norms and Values - Attitudes towards others and community - Attitudes and values are important contributors to community vitality because ideas, assumptions, and beliefs motivate social engagement and action within communities and Canadian society more broadly. Commonly shared feelings of trust, belonging, and caring are markers of inclusive societies. Discrimination, on the other hand, challenges community relationships and creates barriers to the pursuit of wellbeing, especially for groups that are seen by others as different."._
