# Week 1 Course Content
Welcome to GNED 1407 - Introduction to Sociology! This week we are going to focus on setting the scene for our semester. We aren't going to dive into any substantial content just yet, as I simply want to familiarize you with our course details first. I consider week 1 to be the most important week to pay attention - many of your questions get answered before you even ask them! 

Read through this page from top to bottom, making sure to pay attention to the headings and descriptions as they will point out relevant action items. Your weekly content pages will look similar throughout the semester, so you should get used to this layout pretty quickly; it is designed to be easy to use (if you have notes on what could be simplified or ever come across broken links, please let me know!). 

## Learning Outcomes & Key Terms
In this section, I list for you the weekly learning objectives, as well as the course learning outcomes (CLOs); these guide our learning, and can be found in detail on the Durham College Course Outline.

1. Identify the goals of General Education and the connection to course learning outcomes to relevant careers
2. Defining sociology and the major theoretical perspectives
3. Developing a sociological imagination
4. Apply sociological thinking to various contemporary social problems

**Key Terms:** Sociology, Sociological imagination, Social structures, Micro, Macro, Global structures

## Weekly Content: Reading & Resources
In this section, you will find a link to the Weekly Reading (if applicable), and lesson content like PowerPoints and/or mini video-lectures. 

### Reading:

This week you don't have any course content reading, but please read the entirety of this page; lots of important stuff!

### Lesson: 

This week I have provided two separate files; one is the course introduction - this contains important information that will walk you through how this course will work. The other is a very brief introductory lesson defining "sociology." You may choose to view the Google Slides or PowerPoint. The PowerPoint also includes audio captions. 

**Don't forget there is additional information provided in the 'notes' section!**

# Today's lesson will discuss the topic of suicide from a sociological perspective.

## Slide 4: Lauryn Hill - Everything is Everything
- I like to start each class with a song to get us thinking about the topic. There are no right or wrong answers, just food for thought. 
- Consider: What is the message of the song? How do the lyrics or melody relate to your current ideas about the world, social groups, opportunity, fairness, etc.?

_Amy: Lauryn Hill's line "Everything is everything / After winter, must come spring" relates to my idea about the world and social groups as having seasons. Natural cycles over which we have no real control. There are some things that are out of our hands, that can't be changed but also can't be our fault. It's the natural balance of the world, where we can't take any season for granted because it always comes to a close. Whether that's a season of love and light, or a season of dark depression. It speaks to being humbled by the fact that the world keeps worlding while we're playing our social games. Win or lose, or completely lost, nothing in life is guaranteed. "Change, it comes eventually."_

## Slide 5: What is sociology?
Sociology is a science guided by the basic understanding that our lives are affected, not only by our individual characteristics, but by our place in the social world. 
**What does that really mean?**
* People, groups, and social life can be scientifically studied. Therefore, sociology is a social science. 
* Sociology focuses on social relationships, looking at how others influence our behaviour
  * How major social institutions like the government, religion, and the economy affect us; and how we ourselves affect other individuals, groups, and even organizations.

## Slide 6: Sociological Imagination
* The "tool" essential for beginners to sociology is called "sociological imagination", first proposed by **C. Wright Mills**
* It means: The ability to understand how social forces ("Public Issues") influence the lives of individuals ("Personal Troubles")
* Reflect: Consider one recent economic or political change that had a direct impact on your individual life. Reflect independently, or share your thought on the Lesson Lounge discussion board. 

_Amy: One recent economic change that has had a direct impact on my life as an individual is the rise of Artificial Intelligence. After a 7 year career as a Technical Writer for business-to-business software-as-a-service companies, I was laid off in part due to my role becoming less valuable. Tech in Canada right now is in a rough place. In my role, I was paid a modest $67k CAD a year, but in the states, a similar role with similar level of experience is paid 100+k **USD**. Now my options are getting ever narrower, and there is a "gig economy" rising up in my field, where people with my skill set are lucky if they can land a salary. Recently the SAG went on strike to negotiate protections against AI exploitation for writers and actors in the entertainment industry. There are few if any unions in tech, and it feels taboo to talk about that. I guess I could always just accept a contract gig, training the AI that replaced me. And that's why I'm back in school._

Speaker notes: Developing this perspective asks us to give up the idea that our behaviour is simply a matter of what we decide to do. Now, we must combine an understanding of our individual decisions with how they are impacted by the greater world in which we live. 

## Slide 7: Sociological Imagination - Connecting the...
* General --> Particular
* Strange --> Familiar
* Social --> Individual
* Public --> Private
* Macro --> Micro

## Slide 8: Using the sociological imagination
Sociological perspective / imagination is basically the ability to see relationships or influences of greater society on individual lives. This requires individuals to step outside of their own views and biases to explore connections. Private troubles vs. Public issues. E.G: Is a person unemployed due to a personal trouble or is it due to societal issues?
