## Slide 3
**Connection Activity**
- **Song**: Little Boxes by Walk Off the Earth
- **Consider:** What is the message of this song, how do the lyrics or melody relate to your current ideas about the world, social groups, society, opportunity, etc. 


_Amy: It seems to me that the message of this song is that there is an inevitable yet melancholy reality that there are elements of our lives that are structural. That there are institutions that shape us, and that the result is, in the song's perspective, the sturdy but predictable "box" shape. My opinion is that I agree, we are shaped by the institutions, but that there are countless variations of shapes that we can become. And, that we can't put all the onus on the institutions; I believe we ourselves have a hand in defining the shape we feel we need to become in order to fit a role in the structure of society._

## Slide 4
Functionalists believe that every phenomenon in society has a purpose - even the bad ones. 

* **Consider**: Can you think of any benefits of seemingly negative social issues?
* Do social problems stand to serve any purpose for us?

Reflect independently or share your thoughts in the lesson lounge discussion board. 

_Amy: I believe that negative social issues offer the opportunity for society to manifest a positive outcome, to act accordingly in order to realize the aspiration of a truly Just society. Negative social issues could also be seen in light of a worse alternative, for example our healthcare system is not perfect and contains lots of negative social issues, but it is largely considered better than alternative systems like the for-profit systems of the U.S.A._
