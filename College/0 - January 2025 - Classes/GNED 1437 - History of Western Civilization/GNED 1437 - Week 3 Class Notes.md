## Scientific Revolution
### Quiz Review
- The Catholic church used to teach that the Earth was the centre of the universe.
- The persecution of Galileo, stifled by the establishment
- The Scientific Method. Before that, it was "the candle stays lit because god wills it so" to "I don't know how it stays lit, let's form a hypothesis and perform experiments to find out." (if you can't disprove it, it becomes a theory.) You took the word of the authority, what he said, is.
- Inductive reasoning
- Rene Descartes: merges science with philosophy.
- Newton explored Alchemy. **You can't disassociate these people from their time.**
- Does technology come first and science come after? Chicken and egg.
- Exploration: travelling further than their local community.

### Slide Notes
**Test review**
- Describe the reasons why the scientific revolution developed as it did, and how it was permitted to flourish
- Review key inventions, scientific breakthroughs and developments in the post-middle ages
- Highlight some central figures during the scientific revolution
- Assess the impacts of science and technology on the growth of exploration, colonization, militarization, etc.

**Slides**
- Galileo discovers the moon was not smooth, and had mountains and valleys
  - Moons of Jupiter, phases of Venus, spots on the sun, many stars in milky way.

- Seeing so many new things big and small, people began to ask about God's intentions
- It gave people a new attitude over the ancient world and that the progress of mankind and history was being recognized. 
- By 1600, symbols began to be used for things like math, geometry, and algebra
- Linking religion with the new science became an interesting undertaking
  - Calvinists and science went well together to see how science can prove god
- Investments in technology inventions affecting how the results are perceived
- Advancements in navigation and projections led to much exploration and wealth. (Mercator)

**Key developments of the Scientific Revolution**
- Scientific Method and systematic experiments
- Important developments in science, math, biology, chemistry, magnetisim, etc. reasons: new ways of reading old sources and knowledge, also academic publishing, printing in general.
- **Empiricism** - evidence-based knowledge through the scientific method
- 1543 - publication of Copernicus book on astronomy
- Human anatomy began to thrive through dissection of corpses (black market body trade) (opening things to see what happened) (church forbade scientific examination of cadavers)
- Apart from a couple of exceptions, there weren't a lot of technological inventions. 
  - The key importance is **the way of thought** changed
  - inquiry and discovery with experimentation
  - important shift in ways of thinking eventually led to the Enlightenment
- Scientific leaders took over from religious leaders in their influence and credibility
- Old sciences (alchemy and astrology) lost credibility
- **Deism** - idea that God exists but doesn't get involved - just put the tools in place, and then observed (similar to agnosticism)
  - **Pascal's Wager** demonstrated this idea (four-square grid of thinking about "If you believe in god and god doesn't exist, nothing happens. If you believe in god and god does exist, you go to heaven.")

**Key figures**
- Francis Bacon
  - Came up with scientific method
  - Emphasized that scientists should try to disprove things they think
- Kepler
  - Discovery of laws of planetary motion
- Galileo
  - Improved telescope
- Newton
  - Gravity
  - Not a pleasant person
  - His ideas:
    - Must give up on certainty and settle for something less (what is certainty)
    - Uniformity exists in nature
    - the only things that mater are those which are not subjective (pointless to argue ethics)
    - in experimental philosophy, must look at things that are nearly true
      - idea that things are not totally true, but let's treat them as though they are (We don't have to study them anymore, but it's been proven over and over to be accurate)

**Impact on society**
- **Exploration** - new understanding of the stars helped navigation, influencing the onset of the **Age of Exploration**
- **Colonization** - exploration led to discoveries of new lands, peoples and resources
  - Led to much of the colonization of the globe by European powers, leading to the destruction of many cultures and the slave trade
- **Militarization** - science used for military purposes
  - "Fortification is just another advanced math course"
  - Chemistry advances leading to gunpowder
  - Small arms developed → flintlock
- **Industrialization**
  - many key inventions began with ideas and concepts during the scientific revolution (blast furnace and steam engine.)
- **Gender**
  - Women played a greater role than expected in this era, often noblewomen alongside with husbands or fathers
  - still they were banned from recognition
  - in some ways, the role of women got worse in this period
  - before they were just inferior to men, but with new biological 'discoveries', they were seen as opposite to men, so can't work like men either.

## The Enlightenment
**Objectives** [Test review]
- To compare the major changes that had occurred since 1500
- To describe how Enlightenment ideas grew and spread throughout the Western world
- To identify key figures within the Enlightenment

**Europe by mid-17th century**
- As printing press became widespread, ideas spread quicker
  - boom in intelligence and revolutionary ideas up to the 18th c
- Arts became much more popular during this time
  - Shakespeare wrote at this time, as printing became cheaper
  - modern orchestra began with inventions and production of new instruments
- Kings and monarchs still big in this time; elected rulers not there yet
  - as a rule, they tended to work hard, with admin and bureaucracy
  - plus they were meant to be at the battlefield in war
- Violence still present in everyday life, but shifts began to change its nature
  - war was common, but technology of war slow to evolve (unlike 20th c)
  - rebellions common, particularly with famines, plagues, etc.
  - armies went from being smaller and privately assembled by large landowners to state armies

- Video: Crash Course review of 17th century

- Military revolution (1560-1660)
  - New tactics, strategy, growth of armies, etc
  - plunder was important as a form of pay
  - Lous XIV of France kept the largest armies (200-300k men compared to maybe 20,000 in 1600) "I've loved war too much", "l'état c'est moi."
- 1618-48, Thirty Years' War (within the HRE)
  - Germany - swedes, danes, french, dutch, vs. HRE, spain, vavaria, hungary
- Tomas Hobbes (1588-1679)
  - main political theorist of his time
  - for Hobbes politics was part of an all-embracing study of the material world, to be treated in the same way as math or astronomy"
  - idea that men are basically equal in mind and body 
  - i.e the weakest of us could actually rise up and kill the strong, be powerful, etc.
- Europe by 1715 ... Next week.
