## Europe at the end of the Middle Ages and the Reformation
**Themes**: Change, development, and the reformation.

- CLO1 - Describe some of the key historical events that have shaped the Western World in the past 500 years
- CLO2 - Identify significant historical figures and contributions to the development of the modern western world

### Key Points
- Middle Ages in Europe is often considered around 500 AD after fall of Roman Empire in 476 AD (loose numbers)
  - Advancements from Greeks and Romans were lost for almost a millennia
  - A difficult time for individuals.
- Catholic Church was a powerful institution, as there were no united governments
- An era of Kings and Queens, but they aligned with the Church to ensure their power
- Islam rose after prophet Mohammed died in 632 AD, which was 3x larger at its height than that of Christian lands
- Crusades began in 1095 and continued on and off until 1291
- The Plague, Black Death, killed a third of the population of Europe between 1347-1350. 
  - Fear of sickness and death
** Slide deck has a link to a video review of the Middle Ages 

### Europe by the 16th Century
16th Century Europe cannot be directly compared to today's society
- Very closed world with little contact with others - no sense of **nationalism**
- Kingdoms lacked standing armies, institutions, economic policies, national boundaries
  - Drawing invisible boundaries on maps to define areas happened later
- Time was different
  - church time: "Around noon", "after sunset", "before supper meal"
  - Life was lived according to daylight hours (~7 hours in summer, ~16 in summer)
  - calendars existed but they weren't standardized. Time was referenced around important events like "Harvest month" etc
  - age wasn't important, most didn't care. only in the last couple hundred years do we have birth certificates for average people. Record-keeping wasn't exactly a priority
- Concept of space was different
  - Small trips for us were often insurmountable back then
  - most people lived and died in the same place
  - most things that happened were not known unless it happened very close (problems for leaders and commanders)
  - contrast between city and country was very distinct (unlike today)
- By 1715, most of these ideas would have changed:
  - begun largely by merchants and traders who exchanged ideas at trade fairs to help to conquer both distance and time 
  - increase in students and university scholars also helped
  - artists, craftsmen were also important; they were highly in demand and had to be mobile
    - Scientific revolution helped this. There was more demand and reason to figure out how to get from A to B.
  - unemployed moving around looking for meals and work
    - movement for economic reasons rather than warfare
  - pilgrims to a smaller degree
- Families and Everyday Life
  - Kids were similar to adults in dress and very young to work
  - "Childhood" as an age of innocence was not present at the time (nobody cared)
  - 14 was the age of majority
  - average life expectancy very low (often 30s or even 20s for peasants), though offset by the high rate of infant mortality
  - If you made it to 5 years old healthily, you were likely to reach the average age.
  - Diets of lower class usually included grains, bread, with fresh meat rare
    - salting was the only effective way to preserve meat, which was expensive
  - people living on the edge of subsistence, so any disruption (like a bad harvest, inconsistent rain, transport delays etc) meant problems. Food riots were not uncommon.
  - Birth control was in its infancy, and mothers were usually pregnant many times from 14 onwards.
    - high infant mortality led to an attitude of detachment towards children
    - finding enough food for babies was a problem
    - you needed children to support you as you aged
  - Full swaddling of infants until 2nd month was common, then arms set free til 4th month
    - eliminating the crawling stage, made kids easy to carry, kept them out of danger and trouble. 
  - Shame of sexuality tended to begin around middle ages, in speech and depiction
  - socially, public festivals were big
    - Carnival the biggest, 3-6 days before Mardi Gras
    - people did things they would never normally do
    - can be seen as an indication of peasant frustrations of the time
      - indicates peasant frustration was very high, because they found it worth recording that these things were occurring. We can't know what they said and did, but we have accounts of those events. Looking at different sources helps us form an opinion "this might suggest that", etc.

- **Education**
  - Not seen as important at most levels
  - Poor people felt that it was a loss of wages
  - Girls being education was seen as 'scary'
  - schooling mostly quite difficult
    - very formal with brutal consequences for disobedence
  - many universities were founded in 16th century, though not universal and dependent on social status and profession
  - for catholics, literacy was not important, but for protestants it was.
  - no more than 30% literacy, higher for men than women

### Women in the 16th century
- Stereotypes were true: chaste, patient, looked after kids and men's health
- they played a key role in European economy in the lower classes
- Marriages varied place to place, but big change for girls from Middle Ages to 16th century (economic needs of women before marriage and not affording land yet)
- fewer kids also, though mortality rate among kids still high
- often tried to marry older men with a view to inheritance
- women were blamed for most marital discord at this time
- few rights, though did get more if she outlived her husband
- single women had trouble living alone, so remarriage was common, espeicllay with children (fairy tales written around this time, wicked stepmother concept)
- catholic church saw them as little more than deformed men (lol)
- 16th century europe one of the most sexist ever

### War and disease in 16th c
- **War** was common, but few people became actual soldiers (lower pay than artisans)
- Prospect of looting was a draw, though it was a gamble
- battles few and far between
- very few battle casualties compared to disease and hardship
- **disease** was brutal, death was everywhere and part of all lives
  - medicine was primitive
  - most tolerated sickness that today would put us in the hospital
  - Black Death was the largest but epidemics happened frequently
  - Black Death still popped up from time to time
- many thought God brought plagues and sickness for the sins on Earth
- the rich moved out of the cities during times of plagues and sicknesses
- very little medical knowledge at the time
- microscope wasn't invented till the end of 16th century
  - even then, link with bacteria and sickness was not understood
  - Where you lived **in the city** made a difference (geography)

### Violence in 16th c
- Violence was on day-to-day basis. Different from today but similar level
- bandits, bands of rioters, mob violence
- almost everybody went around armed
- emotions went to the extremes in 16th c which was cause for much violence
  - contrast of emotions was that of light and dark
  - anything could set off violence (gambling)
  - jousts and mock battles were forms of entertainment that at times turned violent
  - animal combat also popular
- nobility especially violent, often fighting about status
  - fought against repression from above and below
  - concept of honour very important -- loss of face had to be avenged, often with violence
- Violence commonly used to justify crime -- robber bands often led by aristocrats
  - robin hood figures were prevalent
  - punishments were very harsh so they could be shown as a horrible example to others
  - irony of guilty assumption -- people thought guilty would have to confess before a conviction, so they'd be tortured till they confessed, then often death penalty after confession
  - changes of the enlightenment make this point even starker
- Explanations for violence:
  - health - grumpy bear / decaying teeth theory -- when you're in pain, you're more violent.
  - economic - more violent when hungry
  - social - insecurity of social status, honour and position

### Religion in the 16th c
- Roman catholicism dominates 16th c life (and had for nearly 1000 years)
- important meetings always marked with holy ceremonies
- most prominent building were the churches
- church monopolized education, official records
- they were in competition from monarchs to see who was more powerful
- end of the world was in sight through the dark ages rght up to the reformation
- anti-semitism still high. Christian Europe was still a goal but other religions took the brunt (witches and necromancers)
- magic seen as good and black magic bad (magic was serious at this point, to make sense of what was lacking in science)
- fear of purgatory and death led to **indulgences**

### Threats to the church by the 16th c
- Factors that led to challenge the power of the church
- Rise of educated lay culture
- church had monopoly on education before this
- trade and business increased slightly, more people needed to get educated
- with more money and leisure, traders and merchants were able to read and study more
- eventually educated laymen began to think about religion more for themselves
- vast upsurge of popular piety
  - what is true piety, and how is it different from superstition?
  - biggest problem was with indulgences
  - increase in mass religious demonstrations
  - increase in relics, which was exploited by the merchant class
  - businessmen who see an opportunity to sell to dumdums
- Increased incidents of heresy
  - some religious movements became radicalized

### Figures in the Reformation
- Desiderius EErasmus (1466-1536)
  - wanted reform within the church not without. 
- Sir Thomas More
  - satirist, wrote Utopia
- Martin Luther
  - Wanted to close the gap between God and man
  - Ninety-Five Thesis (1517)
    - Opposes indulgences
    - "good works do not make a good man, but a good man does good work"
    - you can't just do good things, but you have to be good too
    - did not fear god's will (unlike Calvinists)
- John Calvin
  - more hardcore than Luther in strict interpretation of Bible
  - predestination was key, but not passive. people still had free will, but if they felt God's call, they could respond accordingly
  - e.g if they felt like doing good, they are probably predestined to do so
- Catholic Reformation
  - Protestant Revolutions allowed Catholic Church to reform as well, in order to modernize somewhat to compete
  - Europe could have gone all protestant
