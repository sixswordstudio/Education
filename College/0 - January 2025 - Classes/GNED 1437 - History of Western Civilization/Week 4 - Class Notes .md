# GNED 1437 - Week 4 - History of Western Civilization
- Goal: Submit my proposal by the end of the weekend.

## Enlightenment
Europe by 1715 - 1789 are somewhat arbitrary dates for the Enlightenment. 
- The death of French king Louis XIV. 
- Key changes to the state by 1715
  - More coherent foreign policy
  - Concerns about their relationships with each other (Aggression of Louis XIV over 60 years was a big factor, countries were worried so they started to put together conscripted standing armies.)
  - When soldiers go home, they bring their awareness of situations to their families and communities
- More coherent economic policy
  - Taxation more efficient, with better economic planning to meet needs of the state

**Enlightenment**
- Ideas that in today's world seem obvious.
- Empiricism became an important concept
    - Knowledge comes from experience
    - Not a talking head
- France was center of Enlightenment
- Encyclopedia first published in 1751.
    - Idea that more knowledge for everyone would improve life
    - Average layperson would not have any other way to know something
    - Idea of putting known knowledge together
- The Philosophers
    - Enlightened thinkers wishing to inform and enlighten society, not make a revolution
    - Few were philosophers proper, they were intellectuals who applied reason to various fields (science, economics, history, politics, etc.)
- Education had still been seen as a means to practical skills and occupation, and only began changing during this time. 

Enlightment thinkers believed that
    - Scientific progress was endless
    - Law applied to everyone equally
    - Government was there to serve public interests
        - May seem obvious today, but at the time they clashed with religious practices and church institutions
    - They were in the same vein as the Deists (belief in God based on reason)
    - Opposed tyranny, but monarchy was still ok, at least publicly
    - Came straight from the Scientific Revolution
        - Reduce biases, observe, read, come up with your own ideas. Enlightenment was natural extension of scientific revolution not in experimentation but in thought. 
- Growth of literate urbanites (bourgeoisie) - mostly middle-class
- Language began to be united
    - Before this time, regular citizens often only spoke local dialect
    - Now official state languages grew, and especially impacted rural, peasants, etc. (They were left out even further because they didn't understand the language that was trying to be unified.)
    - Death of languages and dialects because of standardizations imposed by the government. Gov't wanted people to understand the laws and why they were being taxed etc.

Coffee Houses in England (Salons in France) were central gathering places for thinkers
    - Fee to get in, but had unlimited coffee - ideas would fly around for hours.
    - Coffee and tea itself was new to society, added new productivity and ideas
    - Upper middle class thing: read and write, afford entry fee, etc.
    - Provided safety and those who ran them were part of the support system (since there was still state censorship at the time)
    - Women participated in these gatherings as well, to discuss gender issues. (They may not have been writing under a female name but they were writing)

Support for monarch was still strong, at the outset, particularly the "Enlightened Monarch"; some examples
    - Frederick the Great of Prussia (1740-86)
        - Freed the serfs on royal land and helped with their education
    - Catherine the Great of Russia (1762-96)
        - Reorganized Russian bureaucracy making them more efficient
        - Pushed education; 1st girl's school
        - **Test question: Give an example of an enlightened monarch. Crash course enlightened monarch video will show this.**

Eventually separation of church and state powers caught on

Rights of man, or human rights, became popular concept at the time
    - Inspired anti-slavery movement
    - Women still not fully considered (lol)

Radical Enlightenment - underground movement
    - Scandalous ideas like atheism
    - Freemasons emerged from here - very secret
    - Masonic 'lodges' where they met others and discussed 'crazy' stuff
    - Exchanged illegal publications and literature (state censored materials)
        - Publishing pieces of paper now, not just full books. Flyers, essays, etc.

Enlightenment manifested into revolutions in US (to some degree) and France.

**Slide 11: Summary of Enlightenment and selected thinkers video**

## Europeans in Canada 

### Quiz Review
- Before Europeans: During the last ice age there was less water, so there was a land bridge across the Bering Strait. 
- Reasons for attraction to "New World": Trade routes, new land to explore, new trade opportunities with locals and back in Europe, to make the empire richer, mercantilism, lumber and fur, persecuted and undesirable class could find new opportunities. 
- The arquebus: "it's a gun thing I guess I'm not a gun expert"
- Les Filles du Roi: Sending women was a long-term vision of settlement unique to France's idea of what they were doing there. Differed from British.

## Growth in the Americas - 1492-1775
Objectives
- To identify life in the Americas before Europeans
- Explore the changes that Euro settlers and colonists brought and affected

#### Americas in 1492
- First humans to inhabit the Americas are believed to have come over during the last Ice Age when there was a land bridge between Asia and North America
- Some built permanent settlements, ruins still seen today
- Others were more nomadic through territories, such as the indigenous peoples of North America.
    - Followed seasons and herds of animals as they ranged. Not a lot of permanent settlement ruins.
    - Settlement ruins are found in places where staying in one place made more sense, or where they required defense.
- With the arrival of the Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, French and English explorers and colonists, life in the americas was never to be the same. 

#### Spanish Conquests
- Herman Cortes
    - Conquistadors. Conquered the Aztec empire and what is now Mexio in the name of Spain
    - Meets aztec leader Moctezuma II, who may have thought he was an Aztec God Quetzalcoatl. 
    - Used the initial cordial relationship to his advantage and soon took Moctezuma prisoner
    - Aztecs rose up against the Spanish, they had to flee. Gathered allies, took the city and destroyed it (in a matter of months)
    - They built Mexico City in its place as the capital of New Spain
    - Huge populations of indigenous ppl at the time were wiped out by European diseases
    - 

#### European Exploration
- **1500s**, keen to explore new areas for several reasons, such as:
    - Merchants to increase their profits, particularly with the spice trade
    - Royals to increase their coffers with gold and other precious metals
    - Convert other cultures to Christianity
    - Basic curiosity
    - Tech improvements in ship design, cartography, and instrumentation made it 'easier' to explore longer distances
- Portugal led the European powers in exploration, though much of it was in Africa and Asia
- Dutch were also influential explorers around the globe, though like Portugal, was primarily focused in Africa and Asia

#### Spanish Explorers
- Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)
- An Italian by birth, he lobbied different kingdoms to support his exploration primarily to earn profits from the spice trade
- Spanish Queen and King agreed to sponsor him
- He had discovered the West indies when he thought it was the East. 
- He got here, his influence could not be overstated, but it would've happened anyways.
- Juan de Cortes

#### French Explorers
- Cartier
- Champlain
- French built up more profitable colonies in the Caribbean islands, particularly Saint-Domingue(Haiti), with tobacco, coffee, and sugar trades (cash crops)
- Work needed to profit from Caribbean colonies was done by slaves brought in from Africa
- Eventually a slave uprising led to the successful Haitian Revolution
    **Video in the slides**
    - Declaration of the Rights of Man influenced the uprising
    - Haiti was one of the richest places by far at this time
- Generational harm and racism still affects Haiti to this day.
- i.e they had not been allowed to trade / access to the trade networks to sell their goods. Hundreds of years later Haiti earthquake. They hadn't been prosperous enough to build earthquake proof buildings. So it is a humanitarian disaster on a scale to rival any other. 

#### British Exploration
- Britain was successful in setting up colonies in the New World
- Is it the mindset of "people as products" that is illegal and against human rights? or the practice? 
- Naval domination and slave trade. 
- On the backs of slavery that the cash crops made so much money for the empire.
- Britain was responsible for about a third of all african slaves shipped to NA by the time the Atlantic Slave Trade officially ended in 1807
- Indigenous peoples initially helped out British in hunting, trapping, and farming, but after the lucrative tobacco industry was established, many tribes were decimated.
- **Video on this slide**: Good overview of the beginnings of british colonialism (minus slavery)

#### Impacts of European Colonization
- Indigenous peoples
- Many powerful indigenous groups lost much of their territory or were wiped out completely
- Up to 90% of indigenous peoples died as a result of colonization
    - Territorial expansion, conquest, war, disease, alcohol, theft, etc., all played a role. 
    - Attitudes were amicable to start..
... More notes on this slide, too fast to follow

**Warfare and globalization**
- Seven Years' War - first 'Global War' involving almost every European state, fought over 5 continents
    - British and her allies won the conflict, changing the course of history for much of the world
    - Britain gained much territory, became the dominant global power, and its colonial influence grew
- Environment: Invasive species destroyed many native species in many places around the world
    - Massive deforestation for plantations, farming, and settlement (the prairies of Canada were once forested)
    - New foods were discovered and cuisines created (many of the world's authentic cuisine did not exist before the Columbian Exchange)
- 

### Notes for Assignment #1 

#### The impact of science and technology in relation to the dynamics of economic, political, environmental, and cultural change
- Explore how science and technology shape and are shaped by society, past and present.

- The economic, political, environmental, and cultural impact of the invention of the Gutenberg Press.
  - Economic: What was the business maneuver that Fust successfully pulled on Gutenberg? What precedent was set here? Which industries were positively impacted, which were negatively impacted?
    - Description: Fust invested significant capital into Gutenberg's venture. So much so, that he himself had to take out a loan in order to invest in Gutenberg's projects. Fust then sued Gutenberg and won, recouping his initial investment plus interest and Gutenberg's physical assets.
    - Impact:
      - Positive: 
      - Negative:
  - Environmental: What was the overall environmental impact of the printing industry over the last 500 years? What was it before?
    - Description:
    - Impact:
      - Positive: 
      - Negative:
  - Political: Whose politics did the invention of the printing press disrupt or fortify?
    - Description:
    - Impact:

    - Description:
    - Impact:
      - Positive: 
      - Negative:
Thesis:
- The invention of the printing press added uncertainty and chaos into relatively stable societal systems that had been in place for centuries. Those that found opportunities within the chaos were so wildly successful that they set an aspirational precedent for centuries to follow, for better or for worse.
