# Week 5 Class Notes - American Revolution

## What Started the American Revolution?
- The treaty of Paris ended the Seven Years' War. 1763. 
- Britain was the 13 colonies. 1763 was the first real "Global" war fought in different continents. 
- France ended up losing, British won. --> Biggest win in western history, changed everything. After the war, they gave up a lot. 
- Haiti.
- France kept New Orleans
- The consequences of the Haitian revolution
    - The Haitian cash crops were so lucrative
    - Canada didn't have cash crops. We had to trade things like beaver pelts and lumber. 

### Road to Revolution
- **Patriots** looked to establish an independent nation and a radically new form of government
    - Essentially just a battle between colonial elites and British imperial elites. 
    - Thus more of a **political revolution** rather than a social revolution
    - This was a conservative thing. No freedom for the slaves being discussed. Northern patriots in new england like (John Adams) but key people were still slave holders. Still, the ideas under discussion were still radical at the time. 

- **1764** - Sugar Act
    - Knowing the impact of the sugar act on the revolution.
    - To deter smuggling, taxes on molasses were lowered, while taxes on imported sugar increased. (forced stuff to go through british ports.)

**Mercantilism** - A turn to "outright mercantilism"
- Economic nationalism that countries should export more than they import to gain wealth through accumulated bullion (silver and gold)
- If you had raw materials in 1 colony, you had to send it back to the mother territory before sending it to the other colonies.
- Gauge of wealth (How much silver and gold do you have?)
- They sell the material to England, then England uses the materials to create products, sells the product back to the colony. Colonies couldn't trade with each other.
- It provoked smuggling and violent conflicts between the crown and the colonies. 

- **1765** - The stamp act. 
    - All legal documents from the colonies had to have an official watermark. 
    - Profits meant to cover defense of the colonies
- Taxes on the stamps for sending letters, profits go back to the British.

- **1765** - The Quartering Act
    - Required the colonies to pay for British troops to be there, including housing them if needed

- **1767** - The Townshend Act
    - Series of acts that put duties on tea, glass, paper, etc.

- Colonists felt that these and other acts were a form of imperial oppression, with the slogan of the day being **"no taxation without representation."**

Lower class began to align with the upper class. They had been able to get things like sugar for the first time, and tea. When those things got more expensive, the poorer classes started to get more invested in this problem. Before that, it was mainly an upper class issue. 

- **1768** - British Troops sent to boston to deal with uprisings from Townshend Acts
    - The Boston Massacre
    - Crowds were harassing the stationed soldiers, and one of them was knocked down. Soldiers fired on the crowd, killing five. 

Lithograph in the newspaper reached people who couldn't read. It's a primary document that demonstrates the way a source at the time can maybe be manipulated. What aspects of it does it represent? What's the tone? What's it trying to say? It looks like the blue coat people are totally unarmed. The red coat people are firing, being commanded, like an ordered execution. Lots of smoke. Merciless firing implied. Innocents and dogs being carried away. It's put in for a fact, but also to demonstrate innocence. Evil imperialists! It had an effect on the population, not just on the rich getting taxed, but the middle and lower classes who were impacted and killed by the evil imperialist brits. 

- "Letters" were published. Great primary documents. Propaganda pieces, editorials that were very strongly worded. No other way to get info out, so they were very voracious. Letters started to convince people that maybe the Brits weren't the great protectors taking care of all the heavy lifting. They are becoming aware that independence could be beneficial to them. 

- **1773** - Tea Act
    - Avoided import duties of tea from the British East Indian Company (Owned by crown. They can sell directly to colonies, so local merchants couldn't compete with the prices. To get the cheapest price as a buyer, you'd have to go with B.E.I.C.), allowing them to sell directly to the colonies, which hurt local merchants
    - But taxes on tea from anywhere else remained --> Mercantilism

- **1773** - Boston Tea Party
    - Upset patriots dumped 90,000 pounds of tea into the Boston Harbor

- **1774** - The Intolerable Acts
    - Stripped Massachusetts of self-government and judicial independence as a punishment for the Tea Party
    - Colonists made a general boycott of all British goods

Canada is an independent nation but we are going through a similar thing in 2025. 

- April **1775** - Battle of Lexington and Concord began the war of Independence and turned the Patriots into rebels.
    - The declaration of independence turned the rebels into revolutionaries
    - Independence was **only initially a goal of a minority of rich, property-owning Patriots.** The war gave them the excuse to convince others
    - Many colonists still loyal to King George III and Britain --> a lot of them moved to canada. (Loyalists)

### War of Independence
- British attacks on Americans became much broader and deadlier. 
- George Washington had a pretty poor record of war as a commander. But even though the Brits totally dominated at first, they didn't follow through. The americans ran away and the brits celebrated and waited for orders.
- Washington considered great because he was able to retreat and keep it together with the American Will, turning complete losses regathered disheartened troops to continue on. 
- **Key problem was finances** as the Continental army and the continental congress were not wealthy. Soldiers threatened to leave. 

### French Intervention
The Americans were eager to get revenge. After victory at Saratoga, French King agreed to an alliance
    - Treaty of Alliance signed in 1778
    - Unusual partnership because they used to be fighting the French and now they are allies. 
    - France was still a catholic monarchy, but America was turning into a protestant republic. 
    - The key here is "The enemy of the enemy is my friend"
    - The only thing they had in common was being against the british

This put more supplies and new life into the War. 
- US officers threatened to quit if they were not guaranteed pensions.
- Lafayette a key figure in both American and French Revolution. (The Hero of Two Worlds) (Lafayette is in Hamilton)

### American Victory
British surrender after the last battle of the war, the siege of Yorktown
- **1781** British surrender
- **1783** Formal end of war signed with the treaty of paris
- Lands in present-day US were ceded to the Americans, though the Brits kept Canada

- Reasons for Victory?
    - Brits were still in their traditional red outfits. The americans were doing guerilla warfare from cover in the trees. 
    - Their tactics didn't suit the terrain
    - Americans were fighting for a way of life

### Creating a new country
- After the war, the difficult process of creating a new state began
- Many of the colonies were in a terrible state
- Returning soldiers not in good spirits or health
- Tens of thousands of Loyalists left the country, and financially most were broke
- The US Constitution eventually ratified in 1788
    - Brought in 3 branches of power meant to provide a system of checks and balances against each other
    - Judicial, executive, and legislative branches
- Bill of Rights was agreed upon and ratified in 1791
    - This included the first 10 amendments to the constitution (27 amendments)
    - Bill of Rights = advanced thinking because they knew the future might want to make changes that they couldn't see. 
    - 13th amendment
    - The women voting amendment
    - The first 10 went all together. Bill of rights. 

1. Freedom of speech
    - Can be interpreted. As long as your speech doesn't impose on others' rights. Yelling "Fire" in a movie theater. Also, the KKK existing to this day. They can still have rallies. 
2. The right to bear arms
    - A single shot, long-reload rifle is different than what we have nowadays. 
    - This was in place because the British were around still. Now it's like open carry, wal-mart guns, automatic weapons, etc. 
    - Does this extend to military grade weaponry?
5. Protecting yourself from self-incrimination

### American Revolution - Legacy
"The Great American Experiment"
    - Many of the ideas were new, driven by enlightenment thought, and had never been tried before
    - Its success relied on numerous domestic and international circumstances
    - For many years it was seen as great example of how to create a democracy
