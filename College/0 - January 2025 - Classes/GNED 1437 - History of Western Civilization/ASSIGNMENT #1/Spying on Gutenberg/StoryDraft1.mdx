The nobility began a new era of Feuding in Franconia. Conflict was rife between the noblemen, guilds, and patricians. Tensions were ready to explode. And explode, they did.
- Guilds: What were their interests?
- Patricians: What were their interests? Noblemen who were like oligarchs of the community. Wealthy and powerful. 

In an era when feuds between noble families started to become more intense and dramatic, people were in real competition with one another for power and financial success. By the mid 1400s, the city had enjoyed free governance rights for centuries, but that would all change in this century. Mainz would end up being stripped of their right to self-govern in the 1460s after long decades of economic warfare, internal feuding, and rivalry between archbishops tearing their city apart. 

Rural Germany was also still recovering from the effects of the Black Death at the time. This meant that hired labour from landless peasants was harder to come by, and therefore they commanded higher wages. The upper classes were putting more pressure on the poorest folk by stripping them of their customary rights to access river water, forests, and commons; adding extraordinary taxes; demanding obsolete labour services; and giving them access only to unjust Manorial Courts (a court where the lord of the land presides over tenant disputes, often imposing fees that he benefits from with no incentive to attend to the just cause or needs of the poor.)

Amidst that background of social conflicts and turmoil, a man named Johannes tinkered in his workshop.

What is he doing?

Johannes was the youngest son of a patrician and the patrician’s second wife, who was the daughter of a merchant. Because of his mother’s modest background, Johannes lacked status among the nobility. But his mother’s influence may have led him to become closer with his religion, since she had been  a member of a monastery. It is speculated by some sources that Johannes may also have been educated at the monastery due to that connection. 

If that were true, that could have been where young Johannes would have first met and observed monks scribing and illuminating their bibles. At the time, it took 3 scribes about 3 years to produce a bible, and their cost of 30 florins reflected the significant time and labour investment it took to produce by hand. 

So Gutenberg had an innovative idea to scale that production up. But he didn’t have the funding to build this invention himself. Who knows why he couldn’t ask his father to invest. I would love to know, but the facts there are at this time lost to history. 

What we do know though, is that Mr Gutenberg took out a loan from Mr Johan Fust.

What is he doing?

Fust was a member of the goldsmith’s guild, and was a financier as well. 

During this time, guilds were organized groups of merchants, traders, and craftsmen. They were Peasants, even though some of them grew to be wealthy. The guilds were interested in growing their political power and therefore clashed with the patricians, who were the wealthy and aristocratic elites with inherited influence and noble lineages.

I want to emphasize that these conflicts were not mere policy disputes or academic debates. These were hot conflicts in the streets, often violent, upending the peace and civility of city life for everyone who lived there.

So Fust was a Guild man, and Gutenberg was the youngest son of a Patrician.

What is he doing?

Peter Schöffer was Gutenberg’s workshop assistant and apprentice. He was the Jesse Pinkman to Gutenberg’s Heisenberg. Or perhaps more aptly, the Anakin to Gutenberg’s Obi Wan. 

He had been trained as a manuscript copyist before joining Gutenberg’s project, and would have been able to see the vision of how Gutenberg’s new technology would revolutionize his trade. He may also have advised Gutenberg in matters of copying. 

Schoffer also married Fust’s daughter.

What was the milieu?

In rural Germany, the land that was more recently settled were optimized to produce the most grain for export. Whereas in the areas settled generations ago, the land was split up into areas almost too small to sustain one family let alone profit from sale of surplus. One explanation for this is that the older land was passed generation to generation, and over time these individuals split up the land between brothers. It wasn’t obvious to the people that it would be in their financial interest in the future to keep the land together, work it together, and share the profits of a massive grain export to make their whole family rich and powerful as was becoming apparent for the owners of newly settled rural lands. 

Mainz was a free city. Each free city was its own special case, but it ultimately meant that they were free from feudal rule, were taxed directly, and had special permission to have their own magistrate to handle legal processes.

Fust vs. Gutenberg - a tale of two johans.
- Fust asked for his money back. 
- Gutenberg objected, and the matter was settled with legal mediation.
- We know the results of that dispute because of the Notarial Instrument

Reflecting on Gutenberg's loss.
- His assistant betrayed him
- He had invented the thing that would change the world, but now he had nothing
- He had some further projects, then fell into obscurity, before being given a stipend until he died.
- Proto-Protestant

Fust & Schoeffer in Paris
- The uncanny bible
- Screaming in the streets and inquiries of witchcraft from local priests
- Typeface source
- Compare the Gutenberg Bible to the writing in the Illumination textbook
- They go on to stamp their name as "Authors". This means that "Authority" is now a power, derived from the invention of man, separate from god.
- He who controls the press, has power.
