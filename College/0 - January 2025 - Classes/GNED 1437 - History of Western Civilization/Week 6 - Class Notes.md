### French Revolution
Three revolutions? Some say four? 

#### Europe in the 18th Century
- Considerable changes
- Changes in Europe throughout the 18th century
- Trade and commerce increased rapidly, along with improved communication, so knowledge of the wider world increased and led to new ways of thinking
- Wars in the 18th century had become more 'civilized'

**Key Reason for Changes**
- After the deadly wars of Louis XIV (and his death in 1715), there was a trememndous search for order and stability
- With increased literacy and more efficient means of communication, Enlightenment ideas began to catch on beyond just the elites
- States became much wealthier with their overseas colonies and mercantilism
    - A small degree of socialism emerges
    - "Helping your fellow citizens" - more organized police force
    - Organized fire forces?
    - "Minute men"

- The church was still very influential, monarchy was still the accepted form of governing, and the people were still considered subjects, rather than citizens

#### Shifts in ways of thinking
- Mid-18th century, intellectual movements began to shift away from logic / reason of Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment towards expressions of emotion
- Expressions of emotion - "Nationalism" rallying around the flag
- People began to feel that human affairs needed more than just reason and the move towards emotion led to **romanticism**
    - Movement in many aspects of society, with art, literature, and philosophy
    - Romanticism was not strictly against reason, it was just a continuation
    - Romanticism became the vocabulary of the French Revolution. (People would rise up according to non-logical reasons)

**Jean Jacques Rousseau** 1712-1778 (First romantic thinker)
- Felt civilization was a disaster, that civilization corrupted humans
- His work "Emile" looked at the importance of education
- Felt childhood was the key point of life and that children were ideal humans
- Believed people should get in touch with nature. That ordinary people's lives were often better than the rich as they enjoyed a simpler life. 
(Rousseau biography)
- "Every man has a right to risk his own life for the preservation of it."

**French Revolution** Overview
- Influence of the French Revolution cannot be overstated
    - Modern Western History effectively begins in 1789 at the storming of the Bastille
- Fr. Rev. very complex, with many phases and interpretations
- Since the Fr. Rev., the word "revolution" has meant a great event (usually violent)
- Elites were split into 2 camps - those who approved and those who opposed the changes. (for and against change is a common theme)
- While still present, after the Fr. Rev., aristocracy and church no longer had the same powers
- On paper, **all people were equal citizens, not subjects**
(Video: Crash Course summary of French Revolution) -- **Good test overview**

#### Beginning of the Revolution
- Monarchy clashed with the Aristocracy
- Louis XVI still had absolute powers by the 1780s, and had powerful people supporting him, including his wife Marie Antoinette

**Assembly of Notables**
- 144 representatives selected by the king from the wealthy elites
- They were willing to tax themselves if their status and power increased
- Insisted they could not raise taxes without the consent of hte larger body that represented the country (Estates-General)

**Estates-General**
- Much larger body representing all people
- No legal power outright - was more of an advisory body to the king
- Rarely met, unless called upon

- In addition to the political crisis, the harvests in recent years, particularly in 1788, was terrible, and it was a time of economic depression

#### Constitutional Revolution
**Ancien Regime**
- 3 societal classes
- First estate = Clergy
- Second estate = nobility
- Third estate = the common people including rich / poor commoners like bourgeoisie
- Each group represented only 1 vote in the estates general

Third Estate resented the tax system. Bourgeoisie found and used tax loopholes.
- Third estate demanded they vote by head not by body. They went on strike when their demands were refused.
- Third estate named themselves the National Assembly and said it alone represented the entire country. 

**Tennis Court Oath**
- With around 800 members, they renamed themselves the National Constituent Assembly

**Robespierre** - Represents the third estate.

#### Fall of the Bastille
- Power, Dignity, Pride
    â†’ of being a voice in the People's Will
- Louis XVI sent troops to dissolve the Assembly
    - Sans-culottes = upper class who supported the Assembly
    - These elites of Paris formed the **National Guard**, an army to defend the Assembly
- National Guard needed arms and gunpowder, so they went to the Bastille (fortressed armory and political prison in Paris) to negotiate arms
- National Guard took the Bastille by force
- Louis eventually accepted the National Constituent Assembly as legitimate
    - New governments set up in cities all over France
    - Tithes from churches were banned
- **Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen** (Lafayette) 1789
    - "Sovereignty belongs to the people"
    - Not a constitution, just suggestions
    - Everyone has equal rights to property, security, and revolt against oppression (Radical for the day)
    - France should have 1 law code for everyone
- Fall of the Bastille considered end of royal power over the people
- Bastille = Symbol of oppression. Political prisoners (people writing things disliked by the monarchy) were tortured here. Torn Down. Bricks given away and sold as symbols. Relics.
- Tricolour of France. 
- "Nothing" = what the king wrote in his diary after an unsuccessful hunt. 

#### Second Revolution and the Terror - 1792-94
- Heads on stakes = deterrence and public humiliation, shame, that still happens even today.
- by 1791 France had been constitutionally revolutionized with very little violence
- It had turned to a constitutional monarcy (similar to England) but some of hte revolutionary leaders didn't think was far enough. 
- Clergy had to take an oath to the state, and church land was confiscated
- France soon went to war with most Europe (King was in favour, felt monarchy would gain power)
- by 1792, anti-monarcy sentiment was growing, and new constitution was put in place, declaring France a republic, abolishing the monarchy. 

**Jacobins** led the next stage, the 'extreme revolution', looking at more socialist gov't
    - Eventually executed the King and Queen
    - Abolished Christianity and created a cult of "Supreme Being" (Deism)
    - Got people on the side of the wars, and built an army of 1 million
    - Under Robespierre, they created the Committee of Public Safety, which began the Reign of Terror

**Reign of Terror** - The point when those who got what they wanted, go too far
- Republic of Virtue -- Robespierre suggested Terror is the means of Virtue
- About half a million were incarcerated or jailed
- At least 40,000 people were executed; 85% ordinary people, 15% monarch and clergy
- Many people felt the Terror had gone too far. Average people ratting on each other, who would end up beheaded. 
- A Tale of Two Cities --> Old black and white movie, worth watching to demonstrate this.
- In a counter plot to bring some order, Robespierre and others were executed.
- Spies in the bread lines, turning women in. Could be turned in for not sounding enthusiastic enough.
- Revolutionary tribunal with ruthless efficiency
- 12 man council = committee of public safety. Collective dictatorship ruling France.

Guillotine - Symbolic equality. Everyone is a citizen. King or peasant, everyone can be executed with the same machine. 

**Directory**
- Looked to get things back to 1791 with a new constitution
    - All males over 21 who fought in the wars had a vote.
