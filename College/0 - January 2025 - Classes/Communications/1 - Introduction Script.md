Hi, my name is Amy Park. I am a mature student in my first semester at Durham College.
# 10 - 20
One fact about me is that I've been a technical writer for 7 years. 

I love tech and knowledge management, but due to the rise of AI and some corporate restructuring, I was laid off in 2024.

That's why I'm returning to my educational journey at Durham College:

- to boost my grades, 
- meet new people, 
- and figure out whether a career change is right for me.

Outside of work, I love to write fiction, paint, watch hockey, and read. Most of my hobbies are done at a computer desk, so I welcome you to my happy place.

Here's an example of some of the stuff I like to do when I'm not writing software documentation or reading.

Thanks for taking the time to watch this video and get to know me. I'm looking forward to hearing what you have to say, too.
