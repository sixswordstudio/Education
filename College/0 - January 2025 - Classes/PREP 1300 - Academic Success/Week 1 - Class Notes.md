* Self-concepts change as one's potential is explored. 
* It is helpful to think about potential in four areas...
  - Emotional potential: How you feel and recognize how others feel. How do we get over feelings of distress or shame to maximize our potential?
  - Intellectual potential: how you think, learn, process, and derive meaning. Can we further develop our critical thinking skills?
  - Physical potential: how you understand and maintain yourself. Can we maximize physical potential by sleeping and eating?
  - Social potential: how you behave towards others and relate on an interpersonal level. 

* Think about how you would like to grow in those areas and adopt a mind shift - a new way of looking at learning / growing. 
* Through learning we re-create ourselves. Through learning we become able to do something we were never able to do. Through learning we re-perceive the world and our relationship to it. Through learning we extend our capacity to create, to be part of the process of life." 
* This type of learning is active, not passive. 

* Intrinsic motivation
