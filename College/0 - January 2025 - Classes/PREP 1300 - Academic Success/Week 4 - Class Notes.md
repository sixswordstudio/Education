###  Active Listening
- Listening can be defined as "the process of receiving, constructing meaning from, and responding to a spoken message"
- Engleberg, wynn, and roberts point out that while this definition describes what effective listeners do, it does not explain how the listening process works
- listening goes well beyond "you speak, i listen"
- listening requires complex thinking ability. 

Hearing requires ears. Listening is psychological. An active process. Sustained and conscious engagement. Deriving meaning.
- Although most of us can hear, we often fail to listen to what others say."
- Listening is so basic that we take it for granted. Unfortunately, most of us think of ourselves as better listeners than we really are."

- Listening is a highly intricate phenomenon that involves appropriate listening attitudes, relevant listening principles, and methods for improving one's listening skills. 
- Listening depends also on your purpose and the communication context
- We may listen more judgmentally when a less informed speaker presents a poorly structured presentation

Hurier Model: Reasons we listen:
* Hearing - To make aural distinctions among the sounds and words in a language
* Understanding - To accurately grasp the meaning of someone's spoken and nonverbal messages
* Remembering - To store, retain, and recall info
* Interpreting - To empathize with another person's feeling without judging the message
* Evaluating - To analyze and make a judgment about the validity of someone's message
* Responding - TO respond in a way that indicates you comprehend someone's meaning.

Different types of listening
- Information listening (listening to learn)
  - Separate what is and is not said

- Critical listening (listening to evaluate / analyze)
  - Be a skeptic

  - Understand probability
- Empathic listening (listening to understand someone's feelings)
  - Listen non-judgmentally
  - Acknowledge feelings

### Note-taking
- Find your own rhythm
- However you do it, there are studies over decades that taking notes in class is directly correlated to ones' academic success.
- The physical activity that expresses the mental engagement -- No choice but to be focused because attention must be paid to type or write. 
- The goal is to ensure your notes are working for you.
- Good class notes should give you a template for the narrative and arc of the lecture, how the course is developing, and brings concepts and themes

### Note-taking formats
The key is to figure out what works for you.

**Cornell Note-taking method**
- Setting up paper with an inverted T. 1 Column for "themes" or "cues" or "subheadings" etc. and use the notes section to elaborate. 
- At the end, there's an area for summarizing the main takeaway for the lessons. Most classes are building something.
**Outline method**
- Goes from general to specific
- Nested levels for nested topics
- Uses indents to keep clarity
**Mind-mapping**
- combining concepts with links and lines
- moves from general to specific, but with visual connections
- concepts that are expressed in visual forms
