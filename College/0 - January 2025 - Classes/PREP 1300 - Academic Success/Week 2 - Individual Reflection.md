# Individual Reflection
### 1. What is one thing that I've learned about myself during this first week of the semester?
Something I've learned about myself this first week of the semester is that I'm not a lost cause. There's a path and a place available for me, not only at Durham College, but in the world.

### 2. What tasks or topics did I respond to most easily and why?
I've responded most easily to the tasks and topics that require writing, time management, and attention to detail, because those skills are part of my most practiced toolkit. 

### 3. What tasks or topics gave me the greatest difficulties and why?
It's been most difficult to mentally shift out of a "private corporate business" mentality, back into an "academic" mentality. For example, the academic integrity module reminds me that writing for a software technology requires a different flavour of integrity than what is paramount in academic integrity. Also, shifting out of looking at my education with a liability / investment / product / value mindset, to instead sincerely engage with the courses with the optimistic part of my soul, not the cynical part. That isn't easy for me because I have succeeded in business, while I have failed in academia. 

### 4. Did anything about this first week of school cause an emotional high or low? What was it? 
It was surprisingly emotional to be back, physically, at this school campus. After over ten years, so many memories flooded back to me, of those times going back to 2009 when I was first enrolled in college. There are so many supports now that didn't exist back then. Coming face to face with these differences don't make me feel "old", but they make me feel grateful and appreciative of the effects of society's progress and of the passage of time on this institution. It feels like a point where my personal life meets larger, macro forces in the world.
