# SMART Goals Workshopping

- SMART goal 1: **To give school the same energy and focus that I gave my career.** 

_Nathan: Here, I think it’s important that your reformulated goal should keep your emphasis on bringing the same drive and skills that made you successful in the workplace to your academic endeavours. That’s an important basis for this goal it seems to me. So, I’m wondering whether something like “I will utilize project management-related tools and technologies, like GitHub Education, to track and enhance my progress in school this semester. I have previously used these tools successfully in my career, so I know I can replicate this approach for my schoolwork, which should yield increases in my academic productivity. To ensure I stay focused and meet objectives, I will make at least one meaningful push to my Education repository every 24 hours, ensuring the contribution tracker shows continuous activity with no gaps in my progress.” Now, I’m not terribly familiar with GitHub, although this did prompt me to just Google it and learn more, but does this capture some of what you want? I don’t know whether I’m properly capturing what GitHub offers. Goals, too, don’t have to be just one sentence, and so you can get the specificity that I was advocating for in class in 2-3 sentences. -Jan 15 2024._

  - S: Use project management tools I'm familiar with to track my progress.
  - M: Monitor the contribution tracker in Github for my Education repository this semester, with more green boxes than empty.
  - A: I have done this before, so I know I can do this again.
  - R: Incorporating tools and technologies, that I have used in the workplace, in my school processes, will help me retain highly valuable but perishable Git and project management skills.
  - T: The contribution tracker only fills a box if I push changes to my Education repository within those 24 hours. There's no way to cheat this time-binding.
 
- SMART goal 2: **To get the best grades possible in all my classes** 

_Nathan: This is a good example of what I was noting in class… The word “best” is somewhat subjective. What’s “best” and why is this important? Based on how you pare this down, what about something like: “I aim to receive high 90s in all courses this term by completing all assignments on time, actively participating in class, and preparing thoroughly for quizzes and tests. The midterm mark assigned for all courses on Tuesday, February 25 will provide a good measure of my performance. Staying focused, managing my time effectively, and adjusting my strategies as needed will help ensure I achieve this outcome.” I still think there’s a lot of finessing to be done; you may wish to flesh out some of this. -Jan 15 2024._


  - S: Aim for 95% or higher in all my classes
  - M: Treat every gradeable assignment like it's worth 100% of my grade.
  - A: It's for sure achieveable,
  - R: I've done it before, so it's realistic.
  - T: Every deadline is an opportunity for me to seize my destiny, own it, and make it mine.
 
- SMART goal 3: **To get the most that I can out of my educational experience as a whole** 

_Nathan: Based on what follows, it seems like “getting the most out of college” may involve attending and participating in extra-curricular activities. I would suggest, then, making this the focus of the goal. “To maximize my college experience this semester, I will participate in at least two extra-curricular events – either as a volunteer or attendee.” If you have any events in mind, then you cite some specific examples. I think the DCSA has a calendar of events that you might peruse. Or check out the Varsity events.-Jan 15 2024._ 
  - S: Sign up to volunteer, or attend events not directly related to academics
  - M: Attend at least 2 events this semester
  - A: It's for sure achievable,
  - R: I've done it before.
  - T: I only have until the end of the semester to complete this.
