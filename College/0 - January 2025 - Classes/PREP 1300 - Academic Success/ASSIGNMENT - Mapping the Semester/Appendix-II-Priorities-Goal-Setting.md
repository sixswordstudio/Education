# Mapping the Semester: Appendix II

## Priorities and Goal-Setting: Winter 2025

### Instructions:
Using both the completed Mapping the Semester – Appendix I - Semester-at-a-Glance calendar as a reference AND information from Weeks 01 & Week 02, complete this form in full and complete sentences. 

Some of the following questions are based on your knowledge of topics covered in Weeks 01 & 02 (both in-class conversations and online).

When you are done, please ensure that you submit both this completed form along with your completed Winter 2025 calendar (i.e., Appendices I and II). 

### Vision & Mission
Recall what was said in the Week 02 online portion, a **vision** is a larger view of your journey. In this case, it’s how you view your academic journey. As we talked about, it can be **what you want your career and life to look like 5 years in the future** or it can be more short-term and **how you hope things will look in 4 months from now**. 

Let’s consider the shorter-term vision for this, and please finish this sentence:

**My vision for the Winter 2025 semester is…**

As per the online content, a **mission** is what you do to make your vision a reality (i.e., the **actions** that you will take). Please finish this sentence:
In order to make the above vision a reality, I will…

### SMART Goal-setting
Now, using the SMART goal-setting framework discussed in class, **identify some priorities and targets** for yourself (review that material if need be; the following must be framed as SMART goals). **These aims should speak directly to the vision and mission that you just outlined above.** 

Additionally, they should be about helping you to navigate this semester and meet your course obligations. 
    
	•	My first SMART goal is…

	•	My second SMART goal is…

	•	My third SMART goal is…

### Rewards
Thinking about the above and, again, looking at your completed Winter 2025 calendar, **how will you keep yourself motivated**, especially for the weeks in which you have a lot due? **Identify 3 rewards that you will give yourself after successful completion of those goals. Ensure that you also write about why these things will help you stay motivated.** (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

### Roadblocks
Looking at the semester as a whole (or the “big picture”), **identify 1-2 potential roadblocks or obstacles** that may affect your ability to make certain deadlines and meet obligations. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) 

**How might you proactively avoid those potential roadblocks or obstacles** so that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations? (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

### Resources
**Identify at least 2 Durham College resources** that may prove useful in ensuring that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations. **Explain why those resources are appropriate** in supporting your deadlines, responsibilities, and goals. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) (Note: do NOT say DC Connect as that is a requirement.)

### Motivations
In one full and complete paragraph (about 5-6 full, grammatically correct sentences), please do the following: (a) **state your motivations for enrolling in this program**, (b) articulate **what you hope to get out of this program**, (c) identify **what it will take on your part to achieve success in the program**, and (d) **explain where you hope to be after successfully completing the program**.

#### Draft Answers
1. My vision for the Winter 2025 semester is to be proud of my grades and my performance, to have set the cornerstone of foundations for further success.
2. In order to make this vision a reality, I will show up to class on time, complete my assignments on time, and take responsibility for all the commitments I've made.
3. 
- SMART goal 1: **To give school the same energy and focus that I gave my career.** 
  - S: Use project management tools I'm familiar with to track my progress. 
  - M: Monitor the contribution tracker in Github for my Education repository this semester, with more green boxes than empty.
  - A: I have done this before, so I know I can do this again. 
  - R: Incorporating tools and technologies, that I have used in the workplace, in my school processes, will help me retain highly valuable but perishable Git and project management skills.
  - T: The contribution tracker only fills a box if I push changes to my Education repository within those 24 hours. There's no way to cheat this time-binding. 
- SMART goal 2: **To get the best grades possible in all my classes**
  - S: Aim for 95% or higher in all my classes
  - M: Treat every gradeable assignment like it's worth 100% of my grade.
  - A: It's for sure achieveable,
  - R: I've done it before, so it's realistic.
  - T: Every deadline is an opportunity for me to seize my destiny, own it, and make it mine.
- SMART goal 3: **To get the most that I can out of my educational experience as a whole**
  - S: Sign up to volunteer, or attend events not directly related to academics
  - M: Attend at least 2 events this semester
  - A: It's for sure achievable,
  - R: I've done it before.
  - T: I only have until the end of the semester to complete this. 

4. Rewards: 
  - SMART goal 1: **I'll buy myself Civilization 7 at the end of the semester to play over the summer**. Keeping it as a reward at the end of a period of intense focus will help motivate me and prevent me from picking it up on a whim midway through the semester (a risk to my focus).
  - SMART goal 2: **I'll print my grades out and frame them.** Having grades to look at will remind me that I can accomplish it, and no one can take it away from me once it's been done. 
  - SMART goal 3: **I'll book myself a high quality hair cut and style appointment.** I can be self-conscious and anti-social, so rewarding myself with something that boosts my confidence will help mitigate negative self-talk that keeps me isolated at home. I may actually look forward to going out if I feel better about how I look.  

5. Obstacles
  - Taking on too much too fast will overwhelm me. I will not try to pack as many courses as humanly possible into my schedule this time. I will not try to create and lead a club this time. I will only commit to what I can deliver, and I will say no if I can't, even if I want to be able to help. 
  - Job offers have enticed me to drop my school commitments before. Not this time. I will be turning off LinkedIn Job reports and message notifications so that recruiters can't reach me. I'll be paying for my certificate and putting less pressure on myself to stay "in the black" at the expense of my education. That would defeat the point of being here and I have less fear of being unemployable if I turn down opportunities this time. 

6. Resources
  - Signing up for work opportunities through the financial aid portal at the school will help me mitigate the terror of going into debt while keeping me on-campus and focused on Education.
  - The counselling services will be helpful for me in giving me a place to check-in and talk through some of my known issues with depression, anxiety, and OCD. If I start to get overwhelmed, that will be my go-to. 

  7. My motivations for enrolling in this program are to wipe the slate clean and put my feet back on the right path to academic success. I hope to achieve great grades that will help rescue my GPA out of the abyss I've plunged it into, so that I can get into a Bachelor's degree at Ontario Tech. It will take consistent effort, showing up to class every day, doing every assignment and taking everything as seriously as I took my career to make this happen. It might take more than just one year. But I hope that once the program is complete, I will be standing at the doors to Ontario Tech, looking back on _this_ moment with gratitude and pride.
