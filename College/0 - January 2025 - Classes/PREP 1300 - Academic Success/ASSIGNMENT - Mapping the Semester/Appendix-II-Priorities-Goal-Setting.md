# Mapping the Semester: Appendix II

## Priorities and Goal-Setting: Winter 2025

### Instructions:
Using both the completed Mapping the Semester – Appendix I - Semester-at-a-Glance calendar as a reference AND information from Weeks 01 & Week 02, complete this form in full and complete sentences. 

Some of the following questions are based on your knowledge of topics covered in Weeks 01 & 02 (both in-class conversations and online).

When you are done, please ensure that you submit both this completed form along with your completed Winter 2025 calendar (i.e., Appendices I and II). 

	•	Recall what was said in the Week 02 online portion, a vision is a larger view of your journey. In this case, it’s how you view your academic journey. As we talked about, it can be what you want your career and life to look like 5 years in the future or it can be more short-term and how you hope things will look in 4 months from now. Let’s consider the shorter-term vision for this, and please finish this sentence:
My vision for the Winter 2025 semester is…

	•	As per the online content, a mission is what you do to make your vision a reality (i.e., the actions that you will take). Please finish this sentence:
In order to make the above vision a reality, I will…

	•	Now, using the SMART goal-setting framework discussed in class, identify some priorities and targets for yourself (review that material if need be; the following must be framed as SMART goals). These aims should speak directly to the vision and mission that you just outlined above. Additionally, they should be about helping you to navigate this semester and meet your course obligations. 
    
	•	My first SMART goal is…

	•	My second SMART goal is…

	•	My third SMART goal is…

	•	Thinking about the above and, again, looking at your completed Winter 2025 calendar, how will you keep yourself motivated, especially for the weeks in which you have a lot due? Identify 3 rewards that you will give yourself after successful completion of those goals. Ensure that you also write about why these things will help you stay motivated. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

	•	Looking at the semester as a whole (or the “big picture”), identify 1-2 potential roadblocks or obstacles that may affect your ability to make certain deadlines and meet obligations. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) 

	•	How might you proactively avoid those potential roadblocks or obstacles so that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations? (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

	•	Identify at least 2 Durham College resources that may prove useful in ensuring that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations. Explain why those resources are appropriate in supporting your deadlines, responsibilities, and goals. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) (Note: do NOT say DC Connect as that is a requirement.)

	•	In one full and complete paragraph (about 5-6 full, grammatically correct sentences), please do the following: (a) state your motivations for enrolling in this program, (b) articulate what you hope to get out of this program, (c) identify what it will take on your part to achieve success in the program, and (d) explain where you hope to be after successfully completing the program.
