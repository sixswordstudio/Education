# Mapping the Semester: Appendix II

## Priorities and Goal-Setting: Winter 2025

### Instructions:
Using both the completed Mapping the Semester – Appendix I - Semester-at-a-Glance calendar as a reference AND information from Weeks 01 & Week 02, complete this form in full and complete sentences. 

Some of the following questions are based on your knowledge of topics covered in Weeks 01 & 02 (both in-class conversations and online).

When you are done, please ensure that you submit both this completed form along with your completed Winter 2025 calendar (i.e., Appendices I and II). 

### Vision & Mission
Recall what was said in the Week 02 online portion, a **vision** is a larger view of your journey. In this case, it’s how you view your academic journey. As we talked about, it can be **what you want your career and life to look like 5 years in the future** or it can be more short-term and **how you hope things will look in 4 months from now**. 

Let’s consider the shorter-term vision for this, and please finish this sentence:

**My vision for the Winter 2025 semester is…**

As per the online content, a **mission** is what you do to make your vision a reality (i.e., the **actions** that you will take). Please finish this sentence:
In order to make the above vision a reality, I will…

### SMART Goal-setting
Now, using the SMART goal-setting framework discussed in class, **identify some priorities and targets** for yourself (review that material if need be; the following must be framed as SMART goals). **These aims should speak directly to the vision and mission that you just outlined above.** 

Additionally, they should be about helping you to navigate this semester and meet your course obligations. 
    
	•	My first SMART goal is…

	•	My second SMART goal is…

	•	My third SMART goal is…

### Rewards
Thinking about the above and, again, looking at your completed Winter 2025 calendar, **how will you keep yourself motivated**, especially for the weeks in which you have a lot due? **Identify 3 rewards that you will give yourself after successful completion of those goals. Ensure that you also write about why these things will help you stay motivated.** (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

### Roadblocks
Looking at the semester as a whole (or the “big picture”), **identify 1-2 potential roadblocks or obstacles** that may affect your ability to make certain deadlines and meet obligations. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) 

**How might you proactively avoid those potential roadblocks or obstacles** so that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations? (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

### Resources
**Identify at least 2 Durham College resources** that may prove useful in ensuring that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations. **Explain why those resources are appropriate** in supporting your deadlines, responsibilities, and goals. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) (Note: do NOT say DC Connect as that is a requirement.)

### Motivations
In one full and complete paragraph (about 5-6 full, grammatically correct sentences), please do the following: (a) **state your motivations for enrolling in this program**, (b) articulate **what you hope to get out of this program**, (c) identify **what it will take on your part to achieve success in the program**, and (d) **explain where you hope to be after successfully completing the program**.
