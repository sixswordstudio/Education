# Mapping the Semester: Appendix II

## Priorities and Goal-Setting: Winter 2025

### Instructions:
Using both the completed Mapping the Semester – Appendix I - Semester-at-a-Glance calendar as a reference AND information from Weeks 01 & Week 02, complete this form in full and complete sentences. 

Some of the following questions are based on your knowledge of topics covered in Weeks 01 & 02 (both in-class conversations and online).

When you are done, please ensure that you submit both this completed form along with your completed Winter 2025 calendar (i.e., Appendices I and II). 

### Vision & Mission
Recall what was said in the Week 02 online portion, a **vision** is a larger view of your journey. In this case, it’s how you view your academic journey. As we talked about, it can be **what you want your career and life to look like 5 years in the future** or it can be more short-term and **how you hope things will look in 4 months from now**. 

Let’s consider the shorter-term vision for this, and please finish this sentence:

**My vision for the Winter 2025 semester is…**

As per the online content, a **mission** is what you do to make your vision a reality (i.e., the **actions** that you will take). Please finish this sentence:
In order to make the above vision a reality, I will…

### SMART Goal-setting
Now, using the SMART goal-setting framework discussed in class, **identify some priorities and targets** for yourself (review that material if need be; the following must be framed as SMART goals). **These aims should speak directly to the vision and mission that you just outlined above.** 

Additionally, they should be about helping you to navigate this semester and meet your course obligations. 
    
	•	My first SMART goal is…

	•	My second SMART goal is…

	•	My third SMART goal is…

### Rewards
Thinking about the above and, again, looking at your completed Winter 2025 calendar, **how will you keep yourself motivated**, especially for the weeks in which you have a lot due? **Identify 3 rewards that you will give yourself after successful completion of those goals. Ensure that you also write about why these things will help you stay motivated.** (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

### Roadblocks
Looking at the semester as a whole (or the “big picture”), **identify 1-2 potential roadblocks or obstacles** that may affect your ability to make certain deadlines and meet obligations. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) 

**How might you proactively avoid those potential roadblocks or obstacles** so that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations? (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.)

### Resources
**Identify at least 2 Durham College resources** that may prove useful in ensuring that you make your deadlines and meet your obligations. **Explain why those resources are appropriate** in supporting your deadlines, responsibilities, and goals. (Please write in full, grammatically correct sentences.) (Note: do NOT say DC Connect as that is a requirement.)

### Motivations
In one full and complete paragraph (about 5-6 full, grammatically correct sentences), please do the following: (a) **state your motivations for enrolling in this program**, (b) articulate **what you hope to get out of this program**, (c) identify **what it will take on your part to achieve success in the program**, and (d) **explain where you hope to be after successfully completing the program**.

#### Draft Answers
1. My vision for the Winter 2025 semester is to be proud of my grades and my performance, to have set the cornerstone of foundations for further success.
2. In order to make this vision a reality, I will show up to class on time, complete my assignments on time, and take responsibility for all the commitments I've made.
3. 
- SMART goal 1: **To use project management tools, strategies, and technologies to track my progress this semester. I know that applying this approach to my schoolwork will increase my productivity and help me meet my deadlines without getting overwhelmed. Pushing at least one meaningful change to my Education repository every 24 hours will ensure that the GitHub contribution tracker will reflect my commitment to being consistent this semester. Using Git version control and tracking will also help me manage my anxiety by producing a well-documented record of updates and edits.** 

_Amy's Comment: You captured the essence of Git technology well. The "Education" aspect is the self-titled name of my repository, as though "Education" is my personal project. GitHub has a bunch of amazing project management tools that I'm familiar with, that will help me keep the project compartmentalized from the rest of my personal projects and well-organized._

- SMART goal 2: **To improve my overall academic GPA by receiving marks in the high 90s in all my classes this term by attending every class, participating, and sticking to my time management calendar. I'll be able to gauge my progress by tracking my grades as they come in, and by preparing thoroughly for each assignment, test, and quiz. More specifically, I will print out the syllabus and the rubrics for every class and assignment, and review them at least twice: once before starting the assignment, and once again before submitting. This will help me ensure that what I'm delivering qualifies for the high grades I'm aiming for. I will also write a letter to the grade removal department of the schools where I have had difficulty staying on track in the past, and work together with professor Todd Martin to edit it into the appropriate tone to achieve that goal. I will aim to complete the letter by the end of the summer term, after I've worked hard to achieve high marks in semester 1 at Durham College.**
_.Amy's Comment: This is important for me because I have a lot of "withdrawed" and "unfinished" grades on my student record, alongside some very high marks. I want my record to show what I am capable of, and that I'm worthy of a spot in a degree program at Ontario Tech despite the bipolar grades on my academic record._

- SMART goal 3: **To upgrade my math skills by completing the SALS online Math course with at least an 80% grade before the end of the semester, and then to complete the math upgrading course MDM4U (Mathematics for Data Management) before the end of the second semester. Completing these milestones will mean I meet the academic requirements to apply for Ontario Tech's Bachelor of Commerce degree after Durham College. This is how I will get the most out of this program and make real step-by-step progress towards my long-term goals.**
_.Amy's Comment: I changed the goal to be more focused on something that will get me closer to my long-term goals. And it's also one that I feel more confident that I will actually complete. It works with my strengths while also pushing me to accomplish something truly meaningful._

4. Rewards: 
  - SMART goal 1: **I'll buy myself Civilization 7 at the end of the semester to play over the summer**. Keeping it as a reward at the end of a period of intense focus will help motivate me and prevent me from picking it up on a whim midway through the semester (which would be a risk to my focus).
  - SMART goal 2: **I'll print my grades out and frame them.** Having grades to look at will remind me that I can accomplish it, and no one can take it away from me once it's been done. 
  - SMART goal 3: **I'll book myself a high quality hair cut and style appointment.** I can be self-conscious and anti-social, so rewarding myself with something that boosts my confidence will help mitigate negative self-talk that keeps me isolated at home. I may actually look forward to going out if I feel better about how I look.  

5. Obstacles
  - Taking on too much too fast will overwhelm me. I will not try to pack as many courses as humanly possible into my schedule this time. I will not try to create and lead a club this time. I will only commit to what I can deliver, and I will say no if I can't, even if I want to be able to help. 
  - Job offers have enticed me to drop my school commitments before. Not this time. I will be turning off LinkedIn Job reports and message notifications so that recruiters can't reach me. I'll be paying for my certificate and putting less pressure on myself to stay "in the black" at the expense of my education. That would defeat the point of being here and I have less fear of being unemployable if I turn down opportunities this time. 

6. Resources
  - Signing up for work opportunities through the financial aid portal at the school will help me mitigate the terror of going into debt while keeping me on-campus and focused on Education.
  - The counselling services will be helpful for me in giving me a place to check-in and talk through some of my known issues with depression, anxiety, and OCD. If I start to get overwhelmed, that will be my go-to. 

  7. My motivations for enrolling in this program are to wipe the slate clean and put my feet back on the right path to academic success. I hope to achieve great grades that will help rescue my GPA out of the abyss I've plunged it into, so that I can get into a Bachelor's degree at Ontario Tech. It will take consistent effort, showing up to class every day, doing every assignment and taking everything as seriously as I took my career to make this happen. It might take more than just one year. But I hope that once the program is complete, I will be standing at the doors to Ontario Tech, looking back on _this_ moment with gratitude and pride.
