### Slide 5 - What Is Culture
- Humans can't be understood apart from social (Culture, society) context
    - The world around us shapes and influences who we are, how we behave, what we value, and how / what we think
- Society makes us who we are by structuring our interactions and laying out expectations for how to be, act, etc. 
- Culture is a **social construction** - an idea created by humans (not animals) through social interaction and our collective actions

### Slide 6

Culture shapes our perception, knowledge, and understanding of the external world. While our senses experience the external world ina  physical way, we must interpret the meaning and significance of those sensations. 

We do not perceive nature directly; **we perceive the world around us through the lens of culture**.

Our retinas may send visual messages to our brains, but **recognition** comes only through culture. We can look at the same thing over and over, but it is not until someone says to us "no, look at it this way," that we recognize it.
