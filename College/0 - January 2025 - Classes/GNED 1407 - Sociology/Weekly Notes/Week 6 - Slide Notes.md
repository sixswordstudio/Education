## Textbook notes
- Culture: The **socially transmitted practices**, languages, symbols, beliefs, values, ideologies, and material objects **that people create to deal with real-life problems**
    - People confront a need and invent a solution.
    - Religion helps give people meaning to life and come to terms with death
    - Tools are an element of culture because they help people solve real problems
    - Superstitions are unique to individuals
    - Religion and tech are widely shared, passed down generationally through human interaction, communication, and learning. 

- Society: A number of **people who interact**, usually in a **defined** territory, and **share a culture**

- Abstraction: The capacity to create symbols or general ideas that carry particular meanings. Language and math notations are sets of symbols. Abstraction is a uniquely human capacity.

- Symbols: **Things** that carry **particular meanings**, including the components of language, mathematical notations, and signs. Symbols **allow us to classify experience** and generalize from it. 

### Norms, Folkways, Mores, and Taboos
- Norms: Generally accepted ways of doing things.

- Folkway: The least important type of norm -- a norm that evokes the least severe punishment when violated. **Social preferences**.

- More: A core norm that most people believe is essential for the survival of their group or society. Mores are norms that specify **social requirements.**

- Taboo: Strongest type of norm. When someone violates a taboo, it causes revulsion in the community, and punishment is severe. (Incest, etc.)

- Production: Making tools and techniques to improve our ability to take what we want from nature. Humans are smart and dexterous enough to make tools and use them to produce everything from food to computers. Production is uniquely human.

- Material culture: Tools and techniques that enable people to accomplish tasks. 

### Culture and social class
- High Culture: Culture consumed mainly by upper classes

- Pop culture: Culture consumed by all classes

- Dominant culture: Helps rich and powerful categories of people exercise control over others

- Subordinate culture: Contests dominant culture to varying degrees

- Language: A system of symbols strung together to communicate thought. 

### Language
- Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: We experience important things in our environment and form concepts about these things. Then, we develop language to express our concepts. Finally, language itself influences how we see the world. 
    E.G: 
    - Feminist Theory says language influences Rape culture.
    - Indigenous languages becoming endangered threatens the existence of indigenous culture. 

### Culture and ethnocentrism: A functionalist analysis
- Ethnocentrism: Tendency to judge other cultures exclusively by the standards of your own culture.
- Caste: Hereditary class authorized by religion

Cow worship in India.

- Multiculturalism: A federal government policy that promotes and funds the maintenance of culturally diverse communities, thus strengthening the trend toward cultural diversification. 

Canada is the world's first multicultural society. The principle is enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
