### Slide Notes
**Slide 3**
- Song lyrics: Sufjan Stevens, The Age of ADZ
- Topic: Bad communication
- "I'll talk but I know you won't listen to me"

**Slide 4 - Social Interactionism Lens**
- Focus: Meaning
- Level of analysis: Micro
- Core questions: How do people interact?
- How does interaction influence relationships?
- Do people change their behaviour in certain settings? Why?

**Slide 5 - Definition**
- Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical perspective that focuses on how people interact with each other in their everyday lives. 
- Symbolic: What do our words / behaviours mean or stand for?
- Interactions: Exchanges between people or small groups (**micro**)
- SI sees society as a socially constructed reality.
- Social construction = everything is subjective.

This theory allows us to make sense of our everyday lives. It wants to explain how we communicate so as to make our social settings meaningful. 

Two people with otherwise similar qualities may react differently to social circumstances because they interpret those circumstances differently. 

Further, this theory allows us to explore how we make meaning of our own lives and find out "who we are."

**Slide 7 - Reflect: Lost in Translation**
1. How might you define a "cultural misunderstanding?"
- I would define a cultural misunderstanding as a miscommunication that arises due to differences in how each culture normally interprets the actions, words, circumstances, or concepts being discussed. 
2. Use personal anecdotes or the internet to come up with at least 1 cross-cultural example
- One example: A Canadian English-speaking person travels to France to meet an online friend who is hosting her for a holiday. When she arrives, she goes to hug her friend. The French friend pushes her back. This is because in Canada, the cultural norm is more relaxed with giving and receiving hugs. Whereas in France, they are more reserved with giving and receiving hugs even in contexts where it would seem natural for a Canadian. Without discussing it, this could lead to tension in the friendship. The Canadian woman senses the tension and wonders what she did wrong, but the French woman was not expecting (or comfortable with) this kind of physical contact at this level of their relationship. If they don't communicate, this cultural misunderstanding could negatively affect their friendship. 
3. Can cultural misunderstandings happen within one culture? Give at least 1 example.
- One example: My partner and I grew up in the same era in the same part of Ontario, but we have different ideas of what success in school looks like. He tries to find a way to do as little as possible to pass, but I try to find a way to get the best grades that I can. This is because we have different values and expectations for our education. It would be easy for us to judge each other negatively for our approaches, but instead we talked about it and came to understand that for our own individual goals, our respective approaches are valid. We can respect each other's differences because we don't see the world as having 1 absolute reality; we share a life together, but our lives as individuals are different, and that is ok. We don't have to fight or judge each other, and neither of us needs the other to behave according to the other's expectations in order to get along. So, we just shake our heads at how crazy we look to each other, and cheer each other on.

**Slide 8 - SI More key terms and metaphors**
- Symbols
- Interactions
- Gestures
- Communication
- Meaning
- Labels
- Identities
- Everyday behaviours
- Experiences
- Individuals / Small groups
- Language
- Face-to-face
- The Self

**Slide 9 - Social Constructionism**
- Born of symbolic interactionism
- We construct our social realites. In other words, we make stuff up. 
- Argues that apparently natural or innate features of life are often sustained by social processes that vary historically and culturally. 
- Example: gender. Often presumed "Natural," but what constitutes masculine or feminine has varied over time and has no inherent, objective meaning.

**Slide 10 - SI: Give it a try**
Consider how sports involve symbols, gestures, roles, language, interactions, and the meanings attached to these things. 

What examples come to mind?

Brainstorm independently or share yours on the lesson lounge discussion board!

**Slide Notes**
- Gestures
- Differences between teammates are mitigated by a common goal (reduces stereotypes and prejudices, and allows us to get to know different people)
- Social positions reflect coaches, players, refs, etc.
- Social status or one's importance a reflection of their individual performances and reputations
- Coded language

- When I think about SI in sports, I think about the role of fighting in Hockey. In Hockey, when a player performs a physically aggressive maneuver against an opposing team's younger or smaller player, then someone else on the team who received the hit will start a fight with the aggressor. They may take off their gloves and throw them on the ice, which is a symbolic act that invites someone to a fist fight. In fact, there are players whose entire role on the team is based around the expectation that they will respond to these symbolic gestures and aggressive interactions with a meaningful attempt to win a fight or to deter bullying the more vulnerable players on the team, whose hockey skills are based more in finesse and goal-scoring than physical strength. Sometimes these fights are a serious release of built-up tension over the course of a game or series of games, but other times these fights are merely symbolic to rile up the crowd or to change the tone of the game. Overall, I think hockey fights are a unique example of symbolic interactionism in the world of sport. It is interesting because it stems from shared cultural norms of hockey players that transcends the dominant nationalities in Hockey: Canadians, Americans, Russians, Swedes, and Finns all understand what "throwing down the gloves" means, even when they don't speak the same language. 
I would be curious to see or read a full article (or even book) analyzing hockey fights through this lens.

**Slide 11 - Important History**
- Max Veber (VAY-ber)
  - Foundational in many ways, but one example relevant to the SI perspective is the "Protestant ethic". He stated that because of the mindset held by individuals of the Protestant faith (sacrifice, hard work, saving, investment), the system of capitalism was born and flourished.
  - Coined important sociological term "verstehen" -- understanding

- George Herbert Mead
  - "The Self" > how a person forms a sense of self/identity through interaction with other people. 
  - He and his colleagues gave birth to the SI perspective as we know it

- Erving Goffman
  - Studied the ways that we attempt to present ourselves to others in the best possible light using the metaphor of acting: life's a stage and we are actors playing different parts to satisfy different audiences. He called this "**Impression management**"

**Slide 12 - SI's weaknesses**
- Ignores larger social structures, like the effects of culture, and other factors like race, age, gender, etc.
- Difficult to research, quantify
- Can be vague

### Weekly Activity #3
- Throughout the semester, you'll be asked to identify and / or provide analysis from each of the sociological perspectives. Let's practice!
- Weekly activity 3 = post in the Lesson Lounge.

### Fake News Practice for Assignment #1
- Language Matters
- **Casual or general information sources**
  - Clear language
  - May include first-person
  - May include emotion
- **Scholarly or academic sources**
  - Complex jargon
  - Always third-person
  - Objective, unemotional

--> [John Green video "Who can you trust" about sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o93pM-b97HI&ab_channel=CrashCourse)

Stats Canada vs. "NightTerrors" channel. 
- Obviously stats Canada is more credible than whatever random channel. 


### Notes from Video: Crash Course Sociology #15
- [Social Interaction & Performance: Crash Course Sociology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUukBV82P9A&t=149s&ab_channel=CrashCourse)
- Status affects a person's role and the expectations of how to interact with them. 
- Ascribed status: NO CHOICE. Assigned at birth. (Race etc.)
- Achieved status: Earned, accomplished, attained. (Student, profession, etc.)
- Master status: Others Most likely used to identify you. (Prof, cancer patient)
  - Important mostly to other people, can be negative. 
- Mismatch in statuses = status inconsistency. 
  - I would like to reconcile the inconsistency in status between my professional status (achieved) and my master status (dropout)
- Hold status, perform role. 
- A single status has multiple roles. (Prof = teach and lead in the classroom. But a colleague in the staff room. Employee to the principle. Etc.)
- Role sets = can demand contradictory behaviours.
- Role conflict = clashing demands due to different statuses held (parents who work --> demands of work vs. demands of family)
- Role strain = clashing demands within a single status (students with extracurriculars)
- Role exit = Quit job, get laid off, etc. Roles are a part of who we are, so it can be traumatic. (I CAN RELATE!)
- Role = guidelines, expectations that we have for ourselves and what others place on us.

Why do statuses come bundled with roles? Why do I have to perform my role?

- Thomas Theorem (William and Dorothy Thomas)
  - If people define situations are real, they are real in their consequences. (Guild officer in an MMO = real role expectations)
  - **Reality becomes socially constructed by you and everyone around you using assumptions and experiences to define what's real.**
  - **By interacting with people around you, and expecting certain behaviours in the context of roles, you actually create the social reality that shapes the interactions that you're having.**
  - The fact that this happens in **interaction** is important because social reality is not about 1 individual. It's about their expectations too. 
  - Dramaturgical analysis of of Social interaction = we are peforming.

- Irving Goffman (Canadian sociologist)
  - **Social interaction** = a play where we perform our roles for each other. With the goal of social interaction always at least partly to maintain a successful interaction that's in line with expectations.
  - To satisfy the audience. 
  - **Impression Management** = Control the info others receive about us.
  -  What you wear & do is a part of this. Props and nonverbal communication.
  - Setting can be a prop. Standing at the front of a classroom. Body language. 
  - Gestures, etc. 
  - Sign Vehicles = convey impressions to others. 
  - What is part of the performance and what isn't? The front stage = audience is there, performance happens. Back stage = drop performance, prepare, would ruin the impression / performance because it defies the expectations.
  - Performances aren't adversarial. We all want the performance to go smoothly.


## Notes to prof: 
- Slide 8, typo. "Langage" --> "Language"
- The "Lesson Lounge" is another place in the discussion board area. Sometimes we have to post to the lesson lounge for a weekly activity, and sometimes we have to post in the general "discussion board". I think that this is fracturing the discussion into too many locations. Also, the slides say that we "can" post to the lesson lounge, or we can keep our notes private. It leads to uncertainty as to whether the reflections are mandatory. Are they being evaluated? Am I missing out or giving the impression that I'm not doing the work if I prefer to keep my notes private? Having 2 separate locations to post, and ambiguity about whether we should post, makes the course more difficult to navigate than my other courses. That is my general feedback. I would like to see 1 discussion board and clear instructions re: posting expectations.
