# GNED 1407 - Sociology Assignment #1 - Fake News

## Instructions
1. Choose a website, any website! Use Google to search for a source to use an example for this exercise. It could be something that relates to this class, your hobbies, or your future career. It doesn't matter - as long as it's school-appropriate, of course.

2. Link us to your chosen website, and then answer the following questions:

WHO created this message?

WHAT techniques were used to capture the attention?

HOW could this message be interpreted by different people?

WHY is this message being communicated?

WHAT values, views, lifestyles are being expressed or omitted in this message?*

3. State one question you have about this assignment that your prof or peers may be able to assist you with before PART B (10%).

### The website
The website that I chose is [GutenbergDigital.de](http://www.gutenbergdigital.de/), specifically the [Gutenberg Digitized Documents section](http://www.gutenbergdigital.de/gudi/eframes/index.htm) because it is a source I am considering for an assignment in my History class. It's not clear yet to me whether it's a trustworthy source, so I thought I would use this opportunity to analyze it more deeply for this assignment, Fake News Part A. 

### WHO created this message?
This website is owned and operated by the University Library of Göttingen in Germany. The contact is listed as Martin Liebetruth, and the link to contact him reveals a Göttingen University email address.

### WHAT techniques were used to capture the attention?
The techniques are severely outdated, with the website looking and feeling very much like a late '90s, early 2000s web page experience. They even have a "Get Flash" button. Flash was a technology that was officially deprecated and discontinued in December 2020. There are image banners on the home page that direct the reader's attention to events at Göttingen University. There is a sidebar menu with simple links to the actual content of the page, all related to the Gutenberg printing press, which is the focus of my research. 

### HOW could this message be interpreted by different people?
Getting more specific to what I am researching for my History assignment, the [Das Helmaspergersche Notariatsinstrument](http://www.gutenbergdigital.de/notar.html) page is the article content I am looking for. The message on this page could be interpreted differently depending on the age and location of the audience. For example, speaking generally, anyone Gen Z or younger may find this page weird or suspicious because it lacks polished and responsive design of modern web experiences. There are strange conventions like the first letter of the first word being maroon font colour, and the image cannot be clicked to expand into the kind of image module with modern tools we have come to expect when clicking an image (share, zoom, etc). Also, it is difficult to judge the site as a non-German, because it seems to be written with the expectation that German-speaking people will be reading it. However, despite the antiquated web design, it does contain indicators that this is a trustworthy source.

For example, it is not an opinion article, it is factual and educational. It cites the source of the image in the body text. 

### WHY is this message being communicated?
The information is being communicated by the University Library of Göttingen because they have at least 3 original documents in their records, and they want to share and celebrate that knowledge with the world digitally. On another page of the site, they say it is to celebrate the anniversary of the Gutenberg press.

### WHAT values, views, lifestyles are being expressed or omitted in this message?
I mentioned it above, but it's definitely lacking in anything that would resonate with younger readers or those who are more comfortable in today's web landscape. There's no clear "About" page that we are used to seeing in the west or in 2025, but there is clear information about the authors of the page once I really dig in to the page. Also, some links don't appear to update the URL, so it's really hard to link to specific pages or sub-pages of topics. Somehow I doubt that this page is friendly to e-readers and modern accessibility technology. However, it is expressing values of quality over quantity of updates, and of evergreen knowledge instead of bite-sized opinion "content" that goes stale after a year. It is catering to the "Academic" audience, and maybe even an academic "class", of people who would find this web page a more "pure" experience than what we are used to seeing in the modern web. I also happen to notice that they did not secure their website with a security certificate, so my browser wants to warn me that this may not be a safe place to browse, and it may be difficult to find again if I do not bookmark it or follow the links to it through other sources. For these reasons, I think this source is like a "dive bar". Good content in a bit of a rough environment.

3. My question about part B is... I was wondering what our prof would tell us about his experience or perspective with Fake News has been. Has there been any sociological studies about fake news or around this topic? I think like others I can find the specific details about the assignment from the rubrics and instructions, but I am curious in a broader sense how sociologists see and deal with fake news, propaganda, etc.
