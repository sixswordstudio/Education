## Negotiation
- Between 2 people
- 4 principles for **interest-based** negotiation
- Positional = Adversarial 
- Yuri the guy who invented this method
    - Set of books about changing the way we negotiate
    - "Getting to Yes" - How can we get the positional person to go past their entrenched position to get them to say "yes". 
    - 
- Principled Negotiation = Interest Based negotiation
- Negotiation = Bargaining
- Interest based = Collaborative

### 4 Principles of Principled Negotiation
- Positional Bargaining
    - Hard bargainers (We  win, they lose)
    - Soft bargainers (We lose, they win)
    - Principled bargaining (We both win, outcomes are lasting)

## Mediation
- A neutral 3rd party

## William Ury Video Notes
- How do we reach an agreement in difficult circumstances?
- His experience: a revolution around the world that accompanies the knowledge / comms revolution
- How do organizations make decisions?
- Previously: Top of pyramid of power makes the decisions
- Now: Networks of negotiations
- Who do we negotiate with in the course of our day?
    - Family
    - Clients
    - Staff / Colleagues
    - Self
- How much time is spent engaged in the act of back and forth communication? Probably a lot of time spent doing these things. 
- In the last 10 years of life, have you risen in power and authority? (no...) (I have failed to negotiate that for myself)
- We have to invent new ways of making decisions together across all kinds of boundaries. We have to reinvent what it means to reach an agreement with others. 
- Framework and journey around negotiation

Approaches quad chart:
- Low to high (left to right on bottom) (concern for our interests...)
- Low to high (bottom to top on left) (concern for their interests...)
- Low concern for both our interests = chicken
- High concern for both ours and theirs = owl
- High for ours, low for theirs = bull

Think of negotiation as a creative challenge, an opportunity. It's not a fixed "pie". **Expand the pie before you divide it up**

Focus on interests, not on positions. 
Concrete demands and stances are positions. Numbers, particular things. 
The key in negotiation is to ask "Why" you need / want that position. 
What is behind the position? What is the underlying need, motivation, fear behind it?
There are a lot of distractions to our underlying interests. 
**How do we keep sight of our interests?**
> Interesting point that we can easily lose sight or forget or be distracted from our own interests

We are our own obstacle to get what we want. 
Our reactive self. When angry, we will make the best speech we will ever regret. 
Negotiation is about influence. We are trying to change someone's mind. We need to influence ourselves first. Self-mastery. 

**Metaphor: Go to the balcony.** A place of perspective. An actor on a stage. A mental and emotional place of calm, self-control, keeping ones' eyes on the prize.
- Remember the feeling of replying immediately vs. saving a draft and then "going to the balcony" before coming back to the key question: will this reply advance my interests?
- If you're ever in a tough situation, pinch the palm of your hand. Momentary pain will keep you alert, help you go to the balcony and ask yourself what you need to do to advance your interests.
- NOT REACTING is an integral part of the process when parties are angry and acting crazy. Go to the balcony and review / know your interests. 

One of the most important question to ask while on the balcony: **How are we going to meet our interests if we can't meet an agreement with that person at that time with that interest**. BATNA = Best course of action 

Salary negotiation:
What is your alternative if you can't get it? if you don't get the job? That way you aren't hostage to the other side and you will negotiate with confidence. Alternative positive thinking = realizing you have options.

Draw a line between the problem and the people on the other hand (psychological)
- Soft in dealing with the people, hard on the problem
- Harder on the problem, softer on the people psychologically and emotionally
- Soft on people = listening effectively to them
- Negotiation is an exercise in influence
- How can we change their mind unless we know where there mind is, and how can we know that if we don't listen? 
- Listening is the cheapest concession - it costs us nothing but it means everything to the other side.
    - Conveys respect, Gathers info, Helps understand
    - Listening within the frame of reference of the other side. 

**Slide infographic**
- Listen more than talk
- Listen to understand, not refute
- 

Not arguing about the facts. There might be many ways to see the information. 

From positions to options.

### Dale / Class Notes
Dale teaches a grad certificate on this. (14 weeks)

#### 4 Principles of Principled Negotiation
1. Separate the **people** from the problem
2. Focus on **interests**, not positions
3. Invent options for **mutual** gain
4. Insist on using **objective** criteria

##### 1 - Separate the people from the problem
- Negotiators are people first; thus attend to human elements of communication, emotions, perceptions
- The problem is the problem, resist blaming and shaming the person
- WHY
--> Pick a problem, make the problem the problem. 

##### 2 - Focus on interests, not positions
- Understanding interests helps us to build durable and effective agreements. How so? 
- **Positions polarize people; interests integrate people**
- Truly and authentically meets both needs. An effective durable outcome.
- When someone takes time to explain their interests, and the other person is willing to listen, that is collaborative.
- Requires more time and maturity, but if you do it, even with someone you dislike, it's benefiting and serving you. 

Power OVER
- Bully / Oppression
Power TO
- Actions / Do
Power WITH
- Principled negotiating requires this. Power that you have together. Choosing our approach, choosing our behaviour regardless of how we act.

##### 3 - Invent options for mutual gain
- The ability to invent solutions is advantageous to both sides; it's one of hte most useful assets a negotiator can have
- A skilled negotiator invents (or seeks out or creates) options / solutions
- Do not look for a "single best" answer, rather, **broaden the options available**
- Try to make the pie bigger. Don't take a bigger slice. Can we expand the pie?
- Pointing out and emphasizing things that already exist vs. inventing new things
> Example given: negotiating for a car. she points out that she is taking it off the lot, which is convenient for them and saves them money. Saves them the cost of what she wants them to throw in: the mats on the floor of the car. Closing the deal before the end of the month, making it more convenient for them, etc.
> Do your research, find out what they value, so that you can get what's valuable to you. 
> Brainstorming. 

##### 4 - Insist on using objective criteria (when deciding)
- Insist that the result be based on some form of an objective standard (i.e not just because you subjectively like the idea)
- "Objective" =/= Not opinion
- "Objective" = impartial, **fair**, unbiased

##### - Go to the Balcony instead of punching anyone in the throat.
- Muppet guys

#### BATNA
- Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement
- Just in case things don't work out. 
- Instead of agreeing to a bad deal, we go to our BATNA.
> Car example: You can choose not to agree to an offer, and choose to go away and come back later or go to another dealership. **A bad deal that is just a little less bad than the last bad deal doesn't meet our needs**.
> Do not accept a bad deal, go to your balcony and think about your BATNA. 
- Your BATNA is not your bottom line. It's your 'i wasn't willing to take the bad deal because it was below my bottom line.'

### Questions for the Prof
- How does one begin a career in the negotiation and mediation field? 
- How does negotiation differ between different cultures?
