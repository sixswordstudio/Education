# GNED 1118 - Conflict & Resolution - Week 2 
_Conflict itself is not bad._

## This week:
- What is conflict?
- Is conflict bad?
- What does truly successful conflict resolution look like? 

## Prof background
- Worked as a consultant
- As a mediator she went into workplaces to help people resolve their conflicts. Having a third party to reframe, answer questions, make sure people aren't interrupted, refereeing (groundrules), etc. 
- Teaches in a prison
- It's easy to see in different environments how having good conflict resolution skills pays off.
- An HR report last week showed that a lot of young millennials are being fired very quickly. One of the top reasons is lack of conflict resolution skills
- Add on the resume, what has been learned in this class, because we have skills that others don't have. (Solving conflict in a win-win way)

### Concepts:
- **Interests** - Important concept for this class. (GOOD)
- **Positions** - A stance taken in the conflict. (BAD)

  * Interest-based concept resolution 
  * Interest-based negotiations

- **Mediation**: When a neutral 3rd person helps people negotiate.
- Styles of conflict resolution


## Class Content
- Misunderstandings, especially with body-language
- The value and importance of being heard and understood
- "You get me and understand where I'm at."
- The relationship itself can be damaged or maintained or improved when we handle conflict well. 
- If we consistently feel misunderstood, or always assuming the worst in us, expecting the worst, it becomes very difficult to resolve conflict within that dynamic. 

### Important points from Async learning
- Conflict is a dispute.
- Conflict is a disagreement between two parties. 
- Conflict involves interdependent parties
  - We need each other to resolve disputes.
- Conflict involves incompatible wants (positions) and or interests (needs)
  - True conflict resolution requires us to go past what we want.
- Conflict is NOT "a fight".
- Human behaviours make it a fight.
  - Yell, scream, bully, threaten, manipulate... these are "drama" behaviours that are not what "conflict" is about.

**Conflict is not bad, the behaviours are bad.**

### Ways to look at conflict
- The win-lose paradigm of conflict is pervasive in our society: some examples of win-lose
  - Global conflicts, war
  - Politics
  - Depictions in TV, movies
  - Lawsuits
  - Neighbour disputes
  - Employment disputes
  - Uncivil discourse
  - Social Media
  - Strained relationships

**Positions** = What we want. But we want to go past positions to get to the interests. 

### Successful conflict resolution
- What does it look like? 
- Substantive issue is resolved AND relationship is left intact (or improved!)
- {People are often conflicted over their individual incompatible beliefs about Justice and fairness. Right and wrong. Who caused the problem? Who is responsible for it?

- **Substantive** issue: The issue on its face. After resolving it, we can **maintain the relationship**.
- Being in a conflict, people need to know they are in a conflict for it to count.

We often fail to engage in a collaborative approach (win-win) because of our perceptions of conflict. 

Change this perception, and we change our outlook about what may be achieved. 

We can achieve **both** a positive outcome (solve the substantive issue) **and** support the relationship.

## End of class concept guide
- Conflict: Dispute
- Negotiating: Bargaining
- Interdependent: How our needs are enmeshed with, depend on each other
- Parties: Two people in a conflict
- Substantive issue AND relationship: 
- Perceptions of conflict: If conflict is perceived in a win-lose mindset, it can affect the way we handle it.
