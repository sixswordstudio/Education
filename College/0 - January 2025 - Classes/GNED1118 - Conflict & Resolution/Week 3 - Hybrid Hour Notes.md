# GNED 1118 - Conflict & Resolution - Week 3
### Conflict story 1
Sarah and the splicing diagram

I remember witnessing a conflict once.

A colleague was a UX Designer. 

She was responsible for the user experience of the mobile app. 

The mobile app had features that were not easy to use. 

One of these features had only been developed recently, maybe 6 months earlier. 

It was designed very quickly, which meant the developers moved through the design process. At that time, the UX designer was travelling for a different work project. The result of that was, she was not available to weigh in on the design before it went into production.

The feature was released, so the company was able to land some of those big clients on the promise that the app could do what it was supposed to do.

And while it was true that users could use the app to do their tasks, it wasn't easy for them. The UX designer had to interject in a meeting to redirect the conversation back to that "closed" topic, to let the bosses know that these issues **needed** to be fixed. This was at odds with what the boss and project manager had planned, which was to keep pushing out new features. The priorities had already been decided, and they were sticking to the roadmap. 

But the UX designer warned everyone that the feature wasn't designed with the right principles in mind. And I was actually ins

### Conflict story 2
**Context:**

I was a documentation writer embedded in an IT team. That meant I was working with people who had specialized technical knowledge, and it was my job to write their documentation. User manuals, employee handbooks, training materials, how-to guides, and other stuff like that. There was someone working in IT with whom I got along great. We became friends. She was at the same "job level" as me and had been there for years. 

Some of that recent history included a conflict with one of our managers. I only reference that that happened because it's important context that helps to explain that my friend was burnt out on IT and sensitive to criticism. She ended up finding out more about my role and department, and expressed interest in switching into my department. 


### Conflict story 3

During a high stress time, when I was working remotely during the pandemic, and I had a falling out with a work friend. There was a lot going on, there was more work than people to do it, and everyone was either burnt out or capitalizing on some of the opportunities that came with that chaos. She was on a team I worked closely with, but it wasn't my team. We did totally different things and I worked for other people, but I sat near her every day. 

My friend was burnt out already, but I was in a totally different mental space. I was hanging on to some hope and trying to be optimistic, trying to push forward and accomplish some meaningful work milestones and maybe get ahead. She was on the other hand meeting every moment with a negative comment or defeated cynical attitude. And I have compassion for why she was feeling that way, honestly I was sympathetic for over a year listening to her talk about being burnt out and angry, even if she did have a valid reason to feel that way, the way she was expressing that in the workplace was negatively affecting me but I didn't know how to talk about it with her. 

I had tried to ignore it, look past it, and just focus on the good. And I tried to spin things, redirect the conversation away from the stuff that made me the most uncomfortable. But it was starting to really bother me and add so much extra dread and stress to what was supposed to be my dream job, like Jim from the Jim and Carl story. Especially because she had been learning how to do what I do, in the hopes of joining my team because she saw that I was not feeling as dissatisfied with the structure / hierarchy / people in our department as she was about hers. I did mention to her that the general vibe and attitude on my team was different in part because we all try to create a more professional and constructive dynamic together. She wanted and accepted my coaching towards that goal, so I taught her what I could about the technical parts of the role, while she was helping me as well. We had a good thing going and we were both growing together but this one thing was still bothering me after a few years of working together. 

Our conflict was brief. One day the way she was talking just really exaggeratedly about how bad everything is and what she wanted to do. It was like horror movie stuff, and it made me uncomfortable even though I knew it was just her sense of humour. There was a point though where I could no longer avoid the conflict, and I had to say something. My regret is not preparing more for that conversation. It was really work-stuff that came out in a friend-to-friend conversation and that made it really awkward, I think she felt taken aback and betrayed. She didn't talk to me again after that. I feel like maybe the tension between our friend-friend and work-friend dynamics within a high stress, limited-time-too-much-to-do workplace structure made this little conflict into a bomb. It would have been nice to have ended that conversation with both of us feeling positive or like we had won a little bit instead.

### Conflict story 4
My friend and I argued because she was always saying things that were very negative and cynical. I like to think I do have a sense of humour, but there was always a point where her negative hyperbole at work really impacted me and my focus/mood. Even though her feelings were totally valid for her, I ended up dreading going in to work, like Jim from the Jim and Carl story. It felt like there was no space for how I felt, which was not so negative about our workplace and coworkers. I really didn't want to stifle or negate or invalidate how she was feeling, and I could never figure out how to approach it. It was never the right time and I just kept trying to avoid it, but there was no way to avoid it because we had to work together, and I believe in trying to work together with people in a professional manner even if you don't love everything they say all the time. Well, one day I guess I was feeling sensitive about something, and I jumped into a zoom call with this friend. Right away she begins complaining and being so emphatic about how much she hates this and that, etc. At that moment I engaged just as a friend-friend instead of as a work-friend, lost my composure a little bit and I mentioned that her negative attitude impacts more than just her, etc. She got really quiet, but she was angry, and told me she was feeling ambushed and betrayed. I think this was a conflict and not the productive conversation it could have been, because I started speaking off the cuff and was fueled by frustration, going on impulse, instead of planning for it. I think if I had really thought it through in advance, gotten some coaching, studied conflict & resolutions, and waited until we were in person to have the conversation, it could have gone differently. I think another cause of this conflict is that we were mixing a friend-friends and work-friends dynamic within the workplace structure, which added another dimension of tension to the situation that wouldn't have been an issue if we didn't work together.

### Jim and Carl Share a Workspace (Conflict Analysis)
**What are the root causes / reasons for this conflict?**
- One cause of the conflict is that Jim is not willing to be up front with Carl, but he also can't pretend he is fine. Jim and Carl's relationship then suffers slowly as they both react to each other passive aggressively, making the situation spiral slowly downwards instead of dragging the issue into the light, facing the conflict, and having a better outcome for both people.
