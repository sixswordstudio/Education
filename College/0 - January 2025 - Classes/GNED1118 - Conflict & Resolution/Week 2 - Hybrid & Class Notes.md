# GNED 1118 - Conflict and Resolution: Week 2 
## Asynchronous Activity
**A trip down memory lane**

1. Who was involved with you in the conflict? (What was the relationship)
2. What was the gist of the conflict? (What was the conflict)
3. How did you each act during your attempt at conflict resolution? (What actions or behaviours did you notice in yourself? What actions or behaviours did you notice in the other person?)
4. What was the outcome? (did you resolve the issue? how was the relationship left?)

1. The people involved with the conflict were: 
-- Janet
-- Scott (names changed)
-- Me (Amy)

2. The gist was that Scott was calling me by a diminutive nickname.
**Context:**
- Jann and Scott were in conflict with each other.

3. At first, I was trying to communicate that I didn't like it, indirectly.
- At first let it go, but it wasn't a 1-time thing, he was trying to turn it into a regular thing. 
- Then I used body language, rolled my eyes and sighed and didn't respond. 
- Jann picked up on that and began to talk to me about things that were none of my business about her conflict with Scott. I didn't have that experience and didn't want to get dragged into it. 
- Scott picked up on that and laughed, it seemed to fuel him. It was tough because outside of work, this kind of banter is the basis of some good friendships. But at work, I really didn't want this to be the dynamic. 

Also, at this time, my desk at work was seated directly between the two of them. 

4. So I resolved it by waiting until the end of the day, which is when we did our best work together (after all the high priority tasks are done, it's an easier / better time for him to reflect and document. My job was to document his subject matter, and he was the subject matter expertise.)
- I told him directly after he called me the diminutive nickname, if you're going to use a japanese honorific with me, it has to be authentic. It has to be -san, not -chan, because we're not familiar on that level. And also reiterated that I'm more comfortable with professional vibes at work. I guess it wasn't as fun for him after that so he stopped. 
- I didn't have that conversation in front of Jann and honestly I didn't tell her it happened. I felt Scott's respect for me increase and we did our best work together in the years after that. He gave me great performance reviews / references and I contributed work to help his projects succeed.
- Jann and I had a falling out after a conflict and I considered that my failure.
