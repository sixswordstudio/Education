# GNED 1118 - Week 3 - Class Notes
### Recap → Key messages we will be tested on
- Conflict isn't bad, the behaviours are bad. 
- Substantive issue = "What are we in conflict about? What do we need to resolve?"
- We want to resolve the conflict that is mindful of the relationship. The outcome should lead to an undamaged relationship.
- Great conflict resolution resolves the substantive issue and manages the relationship well.
- Resolve the situation + maintaining the relationship = successful conflict resolution.

### Reviewing the Jim and Carl story in class
- How to share office space in a way that meets both their needs.
- This is an example of not-great conflict resolution behaviours

### Wheel of conflict

Root causes of conflicts
- There are as many reasons as there are human beings
- Moore and Mayer theory "Wheel of Conflict"

**Five Causes of Conflicts:** (Root Causes)
- History
- Structure
- Emotions
- Values
- Communications

IMO: Jim and Carl situation, I think, is caused at the root by Communication, Values, and Emotions.

#### Structure
Places where there are roles and rules to abide by. Common practices that define the roles and responsibilities each person has within that structure.
- Workplace
- Family
- Organization
- Classroom

Structures have "**Informal norms**". i.e "You should wear clothes when you come to class." This isn't written down anywhere, but it's still known. Anything written down is a **Formal norm**. Structures have both.

**Roles:**
- boss-employee
- parent-child
- student-teacher

When we are in a structure, we have different dynamics between our roles. Each role has different expectations on how to show up within that structure.

Breakdowns, tense dynamics, different ways of showing up in a structure, events, can all contribute to conflicts.

**Conflicts can arise due to:**
- Hierarchical control
- Bureaucratic rules
- Policies
- Unequal access to resources (information, money, etc.)
- Unbalanced power
- Limited space
- Time
- Expected roles

### Fundamental attribution error

#### Group Discussion - Structure
- It is a Workplace, with shared space, so the conflict was related to structure through that
- Nadine: employee-employee role relationship, could include competition or other dynamics.
- Lisa: structure might not be a root cause, communication might be the bigger issue.
- Stacey says: Culture of respect is a "norm" that is not being followed from the beginning, helping to lead to the conflict. (informal norms)
  - Specifically: Leaving a mess in a shared space is not respectful behaviour
  - Being late goes against norms. Not following that expected behaviour goes against the norm and can lead to a conflict
  - Listening to music, being loud
  - Unprofessional behaviours affect people in the shared space

### Emotions
Powerful root causes for conflict, and conflict resolution.
- No emotion is "bad", even anger.
- **It's not the anger that's the problem, it's the behaviour.**
- Ignoring emotions can be devastating to the conflict resolution process
- Is self-regulation an emotion? No. It's an ability to calm the amygdala that wants you to throw a chair. There are methods of regulating emotions that are rooted in science.
  - The mature part of our brain takes longer to kick in and deal with it rationally and logically.

#### Discussion - Emotions
- Agree, emotion is a root cause
- Is passive-aggression an emotion or behaviour?
- Behaviour: Withdrawal, arguments, eyeing each other
- Annoyance: An aspect of Anger

### Key concept: **THOUGHTS → EMOTION → BEHAVIOURS** 

**THOUGHTS → EMOTION → BEHAVIOURS**
- Working backwards by observing behaviour and try to decipher what emotion leads to that behaviour.
- Then working backwards, what thought led to that emotion?
- e.g the "he thought the other guy was trying to get him fired" story.
  - Cold behaviour, rude behaviour, no eye contact
  - Emotions under that behaviour: fear, insecurity, anger, etc.
  - Thoughts under that was that colleague was trying to get him fired. **THOUGHTS ARE OFTEN WRONG, THEY ARE NOT REALITY**
- Brain tries to make things comfortable and simple. A thought leads to a feeling which leads to a behaviour.

- There are *Reasons* for bad behaviour, but there are no *justifications* for bad behaviour.

### History
- A person's past experiences, and the history of a relationship between two people involved in conflict, play a significant role in creating conflict
- we often experience **confirmation bias** when we have a problematic history with someone

**Confirmation Bias**
- Brain tells you to notice the things that confirm your belief, and to ignore the things that go against your belief. 
- This is how the brain tries to make sense of the world and to make things comfortable and simple for ones-self.

#### Discussion: History
- They may have seen the guy coming in late every time
- They have created a history together. They come with different experiences of how to show up professionally in the workplace
- Confirmation bias: They both walking in thinking something about the other.
- History = A pattern of behaviour


### Communication
- Communication behaviours can create conflict, escalate conflict, and resolve conflict
- We can communicate with non verbals, para-verbals (tone, pitch, volume), and words.
- Can strengthen or destroy the relationship

#### Discussion: Communication
- They aren't talking lol
- You don't need to be saying a word to communicate loudly
- Mess, the way we dress, the way we stand, the way we speak, the way we smell, the way we compose ourselves in the workplace communicates something about that person.

### Values
- Guiding principles that are important to you in the way you live your life.
- Values are things that really REALLY matter to us.
- Different people have different values
- to assume everyone should have the same values can cause problems in the conflict resolution process
- Accepting that each person has their own value system in their life is one way to begin the process of successful resolution. 

(Following the behaviour --> emotion --> thought thing, I seem to value harmony, justice, and accountability)

**All five are root causes of the conflict. Causing the conflict to erupt and escalate.**

## Perceptions
We all look at the same things, but we see these things in different ways.

We see the world differently. It doesn't mean that one is right and one is wrong.

## Fundamental Attribution Error
- A form of a bias.
- tendency that people have to attribute others' "bad" behaviour to their "character" while ignoring the impact that situational factors might have on that behaviour. 
- attributing one's own "bad" behaviour to external situational factors outside of our control and not due to our character.

- Showing grace to ourselves but not to others.
- "What I notice is that you are saying I am lucky, but it is actually hard work that got it to me."

## ASSIGNMENT RUNDOWN
