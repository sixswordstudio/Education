# GNED 1118 - Week 3 - Class Notes
### Recap â†’ Key messages we will be tested on
- Conflict isn't bad, the behaviours are bad. 
- Substantive issue = "What are we in conflict about? What do we need to resolve?"
- We want to resolve the conflict that is mindful of the relationship. The outcome should lead to an undamaged relationship.
- Great conflict resolution resolves the substantive issue and manages the relationship well.
- Resolve the situation + maintaining the relationship = successful conflict resolution.
