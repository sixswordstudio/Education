## Mediation Process

**Video:** What are the steps in the Mediation process | Mediation with Bob Bordone

- Intake (Pre-mediation)
    - Entry point into mediation
    - Diagnosis stage
    - What is the pulse of the dispute? 
    - Is the dispute right for mediation?
    - What challenges might arise?
    - Are the parties willing?
- Describe the process itself
    - Ground rules, norms, etc.
    - Designed in part by what they learned coming out of the mediation process.
    - Tailored and adapted to their personal style and the needs of the session
    - Expectations about confidentiality
    - Role of the mediator described
    - Reminder that they are neutral third party, not a ruling-issuer
    - They are master of process but not who is right and who is wrong
    - Confidential. Cannot be used in a trial if mediation fails
    - Pros and Cons of having both parties in the room during the whole mediation. At times, a party might request an individual conference with one of the parties. 
    - It should be made clear whatever the case at the start of the process, so that the parties know what to expect.
    - Ground rules set. No interrupting, assurances that they will get a chance to speak, etc.
    - Basic themes extracted and listed by the mediator. Parties feel heard.
    - Empathy without agreeing or validating the reasoning or facts as presented in that party's side.
- #2 Option Generation: Parties can use the lists to brainstorm possible options, ideas, that could meet their interests. 
    - Depending on the nature of the dispute and the parties.
    - Brainstorming without commitments or judgments about plausibility.
    - Do something collaborative together.
    - More important when parties will have to work together later
    - Improves the relationship, demonstrates capacity for joint problem-solving.
    - Challenge: Parties getting evaluative. "That could never work!" or "That would be a great idea!"
    - Encouraging the brainstorming itself not any individual ideas. 
- #3: Commitments - Reaching a deal
    - Document the commitment in layman terms. Clear and understandable for all sides in case it needs to be made into a legal document.
    - Parties agree to terms. 
- #4: Implementation & Follow-ups
    - Compliance?
    - Mediator is available
    - Check ins at later time
    - Style + Situation = Implementation
    - Ongoing coaching sessions for 3 months during implementation
    - How much follow up is often a style thing for certain mediators. 

Mediation process isn't always this linear. 

### Slide Notes

1. Intro to Mediation
2. How to accomplish win-win outcomes in mediation
3. Steps and ethical considerations

**Definition**:
- Mediation is an interest-based dispute resolution process
- that involves a third party who assists the two parties to achieve resolution of their issues
**Mediator is NOT like a judge**


**Role**:
- Mediator is neutral (unbiased and impartial)
- Uncover and highlight underlying interests
- Keeps parties on task and abiding by ground rules
- Facilitates the conversation so parties can understand each other and respectfully resolve their conflict

### MEDIATION PROCESS:
1. Pre-mediation (preparation)
    - Meet privately with each party
2. Begin the Mediation
    - Establish ground rules
    - Each party then presents their side; each party is heard and understood
    - Feelings are relevant (unlike during litigation)
3. Interests are identified
4. Creativity is encouraged to create options
5. Agreement (written or not)


#### Step 1: Pre-mediation prep
- Examine what is known
- Meet with each party separately
- Is the case suitable for mediation?
    - Are the parties willing to work together at problem solving?
    - Are they willing to work toward a mutually satisfactory outcome?

#### Step 2: Beginning the Mediation
- Build rapport, provide information
- Show appreciation for parties' willingness to meet to discuss their issue(s) and to take responsibility for contributing to resolution
- Explain the purpose and role of mediator / mediation process
- Explain how the process will proceed and how the mediator will interact with them
- Answer questions, address concerns
- Establish **Ground rules**

**Ground rules** Examples:
- Have an open mind and intend to reach a resolution.
- Each party will have the opportunity to speak and be heard, understood, without interruption.
- When one party is speaking, the other will listen without interruption, argument, or reaction.
- Feelings and opinions will be supported by specific facts and behaviours
- If anyone needs it, we can take a break for a private meeting
- Discussions are confidential, except as agreed to by the parties
- Mediator will take notes which will not be shared with anyone outside of the meeting. 

**Purpose of Separate Meetings**
- Helps a party "go to the balcony" (calm down, vent, reassess negative behaviours)
- To tone down a party's aggressive behaviours and build confidence in less assertive parties
- To help the party process and express feelings they were unable to express with the other party present
- To discuss validity and feasibility of proposals
- To discuss how to handle confidential information

**Gathering Information**
- Parties should get to tell their "story" as they perceive it, without interruption
- Helps each party articulate their story in a way that will be understood by the other
- Restate and summarize their story using active listening skills; ensure the mediator understands their perspective
- Identify the substantive issues, positions, and use open-ended questions, and clarifying questions, to uncover underlying interests

#### Step 3: Uncover interests and focus on interests
- Highlight the interests of each side and any they may share together
- Focusing on interests helps direct parties away from arguing over positions and toward discussing the issues in a problem-solving manner
- It is often in the form of a question, linked to their common interests, for the parties to answer. 

#### Step 4: Generate Options
- Invite parties to brainstorm several possible solutions (options) that satisfy interests: **Invent first and judge them later**
- Use relevant objective criteria to discuss the pros and cons of each option
- Help parties fine-tune the options and gain clarity on what is and isn't possible
- Discuss BATNA with each party if necessary (often in separate meetings)
- Encourage parties to continue engaging in option generation process to create their win-win agreement

#### Step 5: The Final Agreement
- Ensure parties have had complete input and that nothing has been misunderstood or misrepresented in any aspect of the agreement
- Final agreements should meet interests of both sides (to the greatest extent possible)
- Does not have to be formalized in written, legalistic document
- Mediators may prefer to prepare a MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) that details the basics of the agreement
- Acknowledge parties' success in achieving a mutually agreeable resolution / outcome of the issue.
