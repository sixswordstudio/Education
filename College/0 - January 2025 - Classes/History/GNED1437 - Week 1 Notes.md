# GNED 1437 - History of Western Civilization

## The course itself
**Prof** Rob
**Background**: 15 years at DC. Some secondary teaching overseas. The course itself looking at history. Main focus: themes and patterns across history rather than memorizing dates. Rob has lived in places we have studied as have some of us students in the class. 

Hybrid course, so there are students from different course backgrounds. The projects in this class can overlap with Game Arts.

### Syllabus
* Complete the Async tasks by Thursday the night before class so that it's fresh.
* Test and quiz materials are in-class on paper. They are not cumulative (so the last one will not include content from the beginning of the class)


* When the prof says content is "background" it's not likely to be on the test. 
* When the prof says content is "on theme" or similar, it's likely to be useful to remember for the tests.

## Week 1 Course Content

### History of Modern Western Civilization

This time period spans about 500 years, and we skip over a lot. These are the bare bones of the most important aspects and underlying themes of the eras. 

**Slide: What is history**
How would you describe history to a child?
- Stories
- Lessons
- Milestones
- Records
- Evidence of deeds

Anything to do with humans that happened before this second is history.
Root of the word "Histoire"

Understanding the tension, ideas, and sparks of actions that lead to further actions and events.

**Video: Why study history**
Past = everything that happened until this moment
History = study of records of events that happened in the past
"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it." 

Actions and words become stories that when recorded becomes tomorrow's history. 

... 

Historiography (how history was studied in the past)
- The past 500 years of documentation has been more thoroughly than previous 1000s of years. 
- In the 20th century it's mostly about kings, conquerors, warriors, champions, and empires.
- In the last 60-70 years, historians have been trying to identify what the average people were like. The kings and queens would not be anything without their people, but those people couldn't read or write and couldn't keep records for themselves. This is why pottery and house-building was important, to try and reconstruct what was actually happening.

**Slide: How do we know what happened?**
- **Primary Sources** first-hand account that comes from the time under study
  - Court transcripts are primary.
- **Secondary sources** Second-hand account, interpretations of primary sources. Good starting point to get familiar with a topic of study.
- Five primary sources
  - Person present at the time
  - Video
  - Document / treaty
  - Pictures
  - Newspapers

Putting all of these sources together makes what the content is saying more reliable. 

Oral histories are valuable but they are not reliable. 

Propaganda is a primary source even if it's biased. 

**PACT** = acronym for interpreting a source
- Purpose
- Author / Audience
- Content
- Tone

All of these can give the researcher a sense of the source's **bias**. Bias is shaped by our experiences and feelings. Our feelings and experiences are based on our geography and circumstances, education system, religious culture, etc. This will shape a person's / country's / culture's history.

The idea of a country is "new", within the last 500 years. It's a social construct. 

In history, we can only look at:
- What someone says
- What someone does

**Video: Sources**
- Both kinds of sources offer something different. 
- A secondary source: Gathering information and telling others about it. Built on a foundation of primary sources. 
You need both kinds of sources to form your own opinions.

Historians are always arguing with each other over time.
