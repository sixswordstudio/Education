### What is a sentence?
- **Definition:**
- Structured thought
- Each sentence needs: subject noun + predicate
- <mark style="background-color: lightblue">Noun </mark>
  - person, place, thing, concept
  - What the sentence is about
- <mark style="background-color: lightgreen">Predicate</mark> = verb

<mark style="background-color: lightblue">The dog <mark style="background-color: lightgreen">is running in the park.</mark>

Fragmented sentence = it's either missing a predicate (verb) or a subject noun

- <mark style="background-color: lightblue">I <mark style="background-color: lightgreen">am.

Antecedent = the noun before the pronoun that indicates which person the pronoun refers to. 

Comma splice = Comma where no comma should even be
