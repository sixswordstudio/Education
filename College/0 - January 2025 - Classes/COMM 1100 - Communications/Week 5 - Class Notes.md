### Email Memo Practice

Hey everyone, 

Great work this past quarter, we're making great progress on the projects. However, I did want to remind everyone that we do have an internal style guide with all our in-house grammar and style standards for communication with clients. We have received some messages from clients who are confused about things that should be clear to them if we all use the same terminology. Please review the style guide before you send your next email so that our clients feel like we here are all on the same page. 

Thanks, 

Amy
