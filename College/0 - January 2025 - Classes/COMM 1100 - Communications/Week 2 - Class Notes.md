# COMM 1100 - Week 2 Class Notes
Where do we get ideas? Where do we get our information? How can we trust that information?

- Social Media 
- News organizations 

"Getting attention" vs. "Informing the public"
- Infotainment

Stories are framed a certain way. So when we get a variety of sources, we can get something more out of the bias. 

Titles especially are generated in a way to bring a reader in to their point of view immediately. 

Titles put you in a mood to receive information

News organizations
- Do they claim to be neutral?
- Do they participate in Fake News?

"Library and information science"

## Growth Mindset
"I can't do that... _yet_."

It's more important that the ideas come from me than to have perfect grammar and writing.
